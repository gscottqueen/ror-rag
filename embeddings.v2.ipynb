    "# Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python 3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended ways to install Python 3.12 are using a version manager like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):** It is also a package manager like npm, and faster than pip or poetry. Recommended.\n",
    "- **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html):** Supports other languages as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uv is installed, you can install Python 3.12 using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv python install 3.12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start a UV project\n",
    "\n",
    "Using uv you can use it to manage your project dependencies as well. First you create a new project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This add a pyproject.toml file, similar to a package.json file in a Node.js project. Better than manually maintaining a requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a virtual environment using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv venv # this prints out how to activate the virtual environment\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate[.fish] # activate the virtual environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus all your dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, finally, we can install our first dependency, Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv add jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a great tool for experimentation and learning. [VS Code extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) is also available for Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice talk about why an interactive environment like Jupyter is important: [Literate Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX1yGxJijsI)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launch VS Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "code .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code will begin inside the virtual environment, with access to libraries installed in it.\n",

    "\n",
    "## And jump into the data preparation -> text extraction part:\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMuPDF is a fast text extraction library for python, it is open source with an AGPL 3.0 license. Other alternatives you should look at are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) from IBM.\n",

      "###### Revision  The racing rules are revised and published every four years by World Sailing, the international authority for the sport. This edition becomes effective on 1 January 2021 except that for an event beginning in 2020 the date may be postponed by the notice of race or sailing instructions. Marginal markings indicate important changes to Parts 1–7 and the Definitions in the 2017–2020 edition. No changes are contemplated before 2025, but any changes determined to be urgent before then will be announced through national authorities and posted on the World Sailing website.\n",
      "\n",
      " Appendices  When the rules of an appendix apply, they take precedence over any conflicting rules in Parts 1–7 and the Definitions. Each appendix is identified by a letter. A reference to a rule in an appendix will contain the letter and the rule number (for example, ‘rule A1’). The letters I, O and Q are not used to designate appendices in this book.\n",
      "\n",
      " World Sailing Regulations  The Regulations are referred to in the definition Rule and in rule 6, but they are not included in this book because they can be changed at any time. The most recent versions of the Regulations are published on the World Sailing website; new versions will be announced through national authorities.\n",

      "\n",
      " • Interpretations of the Regulations, for those Regulations that\n",

      " Abandon  A race that a race committee or protest committee abandons is void but may be resailed.\n",
      "\n",
      " Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One boat is clear astern of another when her hull and equipment in normal position are behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other boat’s hull and equipment in normal position. The other boat is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a boat between them overlaps both. These terms always apply to boats on the same tack. They apply to boats on opposite tacks only when rule 18 applies between them or when both boats are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\n",
      "\n",
      " Conflict of Interest  A person has a conflict of interest if he\n",
      "\n",
      " (a) may gain or lose as a result of a decision to which he contributes,\n",
      "\n",
      " (b) may reasonably appear to have a personal or financial interest which could affect his ability to be impartial, or \n",
      "\n",
      " (c) has a close personal interest in a decision. \n",
      "\n",
      " Fetching A boat is fetching a mark when she is in a position to pass to windward of it and leave it on the required side without changing tack.\n",
      "\n",
      " Finish A boat finishes when, after starting, any part of her hull crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\n",

      " (c) continues to sail the course. \n",
      "\n",
      " Keep Clear  A boat keeps clear of a right-of-way boat\n",
      "\n",
      " (a) if the right-of-way boat can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and, \n",

      "###### Leeward and Windward  A boat’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her mainsail lies. The other side is her windward side. When two boats on the same tack overlap, the one on the leeward side of the other is the leeward boat. The other is the windward boat.\n",
      "\n",
      " Mark  An object the sailing instructions require a boat to leave on a specified side, a race committee vessel surrounded by navigable water from which the starting or finishing line extends, and an object intentionally attached to the object or vessel. However, an anchor line is not part of the mark. \n",

      "\n",
      " (a) room to sail to the mark when her proper course is to sail close to it, and\n",
      "\n",
      " (b) room to round or pass the mark as necessary to sail the course without touching the mark. \n",
      "\n",
      " However, mark-room for a boat does not include room to tack unless she is overlapped inside and to windward of the boat required to give mark-room and she would be fetching the mark after her tack.\n",
      "\n",
      " Obstruction  An object that a boat could not pass without changing course substantially, if she were sailing directly towards it and one of her hull lengths from it. An object that can be safely passed on only one side and an object, area or line so designated by the sailing instructions are also obstructions. However, a boat racing is not an obstruction to other boats unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. A vessel under way, including a boat racing, is never a continuing obstruction.\n",

      "\n",
      " Postpone  A postponed race is delayed before its scheduled start but may be started or abandoned later.\n",
      "\n",
      " Proper Course  A course a boat would choose in order to sail the course and finish as soon as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to in the rule using the term. A boat has no proper course before her starting signal.\n",
      "\n",
      " Protest  An allegation made under rule 61.2 by a boat, a race committee, a technical committee or a protest committee that a boat has broken a rule.\n",

The other kiteboard is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a kiteboard between them overlaps both. If there is reasonable doubt that two kiteboards are overlapped, it shall be presumed that they are not. These terms always apply to kiteboards on the same tack. They apply to kiteboards on opposite tacks only when both kiteboards are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind. \n",

An object that can be safely passed on only one side and an object, area or line so designated by the sailing instructions are also obstructions. However, a kiteboard racing is not an obstruction to other kiteboards unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. A vessel under way, including a kiteboard racing, is never a continuing obstruction. \n",

      " ● At the start of any hearing, ensure that the parties are aware of any conflicts of interest of protest committee members. Ask the parties if they consent to the members. If a party does not object as soon as possible after a conflict of interest has been declared, the protest committee may take this as consent to proceed and should record it.\n",
      "\n",
      " ● If a party objects to a member, the remainder of the protest committee members need to assess whether the conflict of interest is significant. The assessment will consider the level of the event, the level of the conflict and the perception of fairness. It may be acceptable to balance conflicts between protest committee members. Guidance may be found on the World Sailing website. Record the decision and the grounds for that decision.\n",

AI is\\na disruptive technology that has become increasingly ubiquitous\\nand pervasive in modern societies. Extremely transformative, they\\nhave advanced rapidly, and affect virtually every aspect of our\\nexistence, including the way we interact with and transact within\\nsociety. AI has provided many benefits, which were previously\\nunimaginable, and has had a significant impact across diverse\\ncontexts, including education, healthcare, financial services, the\\ndelivery of justice, and the defence sector, to name a few. Today,\\nmany governments worldwide are at the nascent stages of\\nintegrating AI into their operations to gain efficiency and realize\\ncost savings, improve the quality of services delivered to citizens,\\nand enhance policymaking capabilities[2]. The voluminous data that\\ncharacterizes government agencies provides an ideal environment\\nfor adopting AI to learn from and efficiently process these data to\\nresolve administrative problems in ways not previously possible.\\n\\n\\nKey recommendations\\n\\n- **Develop national AI strategies that**\\n**articulate the vision and policy framework**\\n**towards the adoption of AI, particularly**\\n**within the public sector.**\\n\\n- **Assess the current and potential**\\n**effectiveness of AI adoption in the public**\\n**sector on public value creation.**\\n\\n- **Embrace the public value management**\\n**paradigm within the context of public**\\n**sector reform.**\\n\\n- **Develop national AI capability to ensure**\\n**requisite human resources to drive all**\\n**aspects of AI adoption within the**\\n**public sector.**\\n\\n\\n\\n- **Integrate AI systems in the public sector**\\n**in a structural manner with a changing**\\n**mindsets approach to public administration.**\\n\\n\\n1 Given the continuing advances in technology, Artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a system to identify, interpret, make inferences and learn from\\n\\ndata to achieve predetermined organizational and societal goals (Mikalef and Gupta, 2021).\\n\\n2 The objective of this Policy Brief is to foster interest and draw attention to the opportunities for AI adoption within the public sector to create public value. While AI',\n",
       " 'regulation is an important consideration, this issue is not directly addressed here.\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nNotwithstanding the recent advances in AI, including\\nthe release of generative AI and the opportunities to\\nfoster AI innovation within public sector\\n\\norganizations, governments are challenged “to ensure\\nthat AI is adopted effectively for the public good”\\n(Hankins et al., 2023, p. 4). It remains to be seen what\\neffect AI will have on responsibilities and public\\nvalues upheld by governments.\\n\\nPublic value management has emerged as a leading\\npublic management paradigm in the post-traditional\\nbureaucracy and new public management (NPM)\\ngovernance models era. It is based on the democratic\\nprocess to explain the undergirding of public action\\nand to mitigate failures of the previous models in the\\npublic sector. In this regard, public value does not\\nonly focus on efficiency and goal achievement, but\\nalso emphasizes the fulfilment of societal\\n\\nexpectations and publicly-held values, including\\nequity, transparency, and responsiveness, by taking\\ninto consideration citizens’ preferences. Within the\\ncontext of public administration and policy, this\\nparadigm is critical for public sector administrators. In\\nparticular, public sector administrators strategically\\ncreate public value through a heightened emphasis on\\ndemocratic and collaborative governance and\\n\\ncitizenship to deliver quality public services (Moore,\\n1995; O’Flynn, 2007; Benington, 2009; Bojang,\\n2020). Thus, the government has a special role as\\nguarantor of public values, that is, going beyond\\nmerely being the supervisor and provider of services\\nto the public to value creation in the public sector.\\n\\nTherefore, in light of the growing emphasis for\\ngovernments to employ AI-enabled services, it is\\ncritical that the needs of citizens, as the primary\\nbeneficiaries of public services, remain paramount\\nwhile harnessing the potential of artificial\\n\\nintelligence. Within this context, if public sector\\norganizations are to fully harness the power of AI to\\ndeliver more efficient, inclusive and transparent\\nservices to citizens, it is important to clearly\\nunderstand the challenges of AI and avoid potential\\npitfalls by implementing appropriate mitigation\\nstrategies. To that end, this policy brief explores the\\ninterconnections between the deployment of artificial\\nintelligence within the public sector and public value\\ncreation, and proposes a framework for assessing the\\neffectiveness of AI adoption in the public sector and\\nits potential for public value creation.',\n",
       " '### Unlocking the potential value of artificial intelligence in the public sector\\n\\nWith the expansion of digital government, artificial\\nintelligence and the collection and analysis of big\\ndata are set to make the public sector organizations\\nleaner with increased levels of efficiency and\\nresponsiveness to the needs of citizens, all the while\\nstrengthening bureaucracy’s core purpose. With the\\nintroduction of AI-technologies in government\\npublic-sector ecosystems, traditional approaches to\\nservice provision, policymaking and enforcement\\ncan change rapidly. In addition, the public\\ngovernance implications for AI use in government\\ncan be varied. In this regard, the rise of AI use in\\ngovernment, together with the increased level of\\nsophistication of these applications has triggered\\nseveral public governance questions.\\n\\nTraditional approaches to service delivery have been\\nrapidly changing. Globally, AI has been used to\\nimprove the quality of services, foster the trust of\\ncitizens, as well as increase service delivery\\nefficiency and effectiveness. Altogether, proactive\\ngovernments have achieved greater levels of accurate\\nforecasting and enhanced levels of policymaking, as\\nvalue has been created in various functional areas,\\nincluding “decision support, transportation, public\\nhealth and law enforcement” (Zuiderwijk, et al., 2021).\\n\\nNotwithstanding, the use of AI within the public\\nsector can create some challenges and considerations\\nwhich must be addressed. At the core, it is critical\\nthat the adoption of AI in the public sector advances\\nthe public good. In this regard, to ensure citizens’\\nconfidence, the use of this technology must be\\ntransparent and predictable, such that the outcomes\\nare inclusive, fair, free of bias, and adhere to societal\\nconcerns for citizen privacy, safety, and trust.\\n\\nAdopting new technologies can be one of the main\\napproaches for transforming governments.

Within\\nfour months of that release, GPT-4 was unveiled,\\nwhich exponentially expanded the processing\\ncapability of this system to enable it to exhibit humanlevel performance. In two months, the website had\\ngarnered over 100 million users, making it the fastestgrowing website in history (Wheeler, 2023).\\n\\nAt this pace, and with the introduction of new\\ntechnology players into the global AI race, existing\\nrules and legal guardrails can be woefully\\ninsufficient to deal with the velocity of AI\\ndevelopments. These guardrails, which were predicated\\non regulatory assumptions for expanding the\\nphysical power of humans, lack the focus and agility\\nto be meaningful for artificial intelligence and its\\naugmenting of cognitive power. This can have direct\\nconsequences for the regulatory considerations of\\nprivacy, competition, manipulation and misinformation,\\nparticularly given that the accuracy of AI models\\nincreases with the expansion of the data on which it\\nis trained. In this regard, traversing the regulatory\\ntightrope in the AI era between protecting public\\ninterest and promoting innovation and investment\\nrequires a multi-layered analysis for AI that\\ntakes cognizance of the varied use cases and\\ntheir accompanying applications, adoptions and\\ninherent risks.\\n\\nIn the hope of making government services more\\neffective and responsive, public sector agencies have\\nbegun to deploy AI applications that implement\\ngovernment policies.

Public value management, therefore, represents\\n\\n\\na paradigm shift in the way public agencies manage\\nand deliver services to citizens.\\n\\nThis mode of management places value creation as\\nthe primary focus for public organizations, which has\\nnecessitated that public administrators model the\\norganization “by showing transversal processes that\\ncreate value for … different stakeholders … through\\nactivities and processes, outputs and outcomes”\\n(Amrani _et al., 2022, p. 363).

However, one of the\\nfactors hindering progress is the lack of humanrelated AI capability within public organizations.\\nBoth technical and non-technical human skillsets are\\nrequired for the successful implementation of AI in\\nthe public sector. Mikalef et al. (2023) define AI\\ncapability as the innovation needed to uptake\\nartificial intelligence. The mere existence of AI\\nwithin a public administration does not necessarily\\ncreate public value. The ability to deploy AI\\nsolutions that improve quality and efficiency requires\\ninternal competencies which transcend the\\n\\nmotivation to use AI technologies. To derive value\\nfrom AI technologies, not only do AI systems have\\nto be successfully developed and deployed, they\\nmust also be integrated into the organization in a\\nstructural manner and with a changing mindsets\\napproach to public administration.

Rather, every public servant must have\\nsome form of AI-related competencies, enabling\\nthem to find new ways of working with AI systems,\\nchanging traditional work procedures, as well as their\\nattitudes, to embrace new technologies to achieve\\nimproved outcomes.\\n\\nThe adoption of AI in the public sector is\\ntransformative and will affect the domestic labour\\nmarket and educational institutions with the need for\\nreskilling and upskilling of competencies to ensure\\ncontinued employability within an AI-enabled public\\nsector. In this regard, the current labour force would\\nneed to possess unique tools and capabilities to\\nsucceed in a future with AI. New skillsets are\\nrequired, particularly taking into consideration that\\nseveral jobs and occupations in the public sector will\\nbe at risk of being automated. In this regard, it would\\nbe critical for government to adopt the role of enabler,\\nproviding the requisite political commitment and\\nfunding to ensure that training institutions are able to',\n",

AI is\\na disruptive technology that has become increasingly ubiquitous\\nand pervasive in modern societies. Extremely transformative, they\\nhave advanced rapidly, and affect virtually every aspect of our\\nexistence, including the way we interact with and transact within\\nsociety. AI has provided many benefits, which were previously\\nunimaginable, and has had a significant impact across diverse\\ncontexts, including education, healthcare, financial services, the\\ndelivery of justice, and the defence sector, to name a few. Today,\\nmany governments worldwide are at the nascent stages of\\nintegrating AI into their operations to gain efficiency and realize\\ncost savings, improve the quality of services delivered to citizens,\\nand enhance policymaking capabilities[2]. The voluminous data that\\ncharacterizes government agencies provides an ideal environment\\nfor adopting AI to learn from and efficiently process these data to\\nresolve administrative problems in ways not previously possible.\\n\\n\\nKey recommendations\\n\\n- **Develop national AI strategies that**\\n**articulate the vision and policy framework**\\n**towards the adoption of AI, particularly**\\n**within the public sector.**\\n\\n- **Assess the current and potential**\\n**effectiveness of AI adoption in the public**\\n**sector on public value creation.**\\n\\n- **Embrace the public value management**\\n**paradigm within the context of public**\\n**sector reform.**\\n\\n- **Develop national AI capability to ensure**\\n**requisite human resources to drive all**\\n**aspects of AI adoption within the**\\n**public sector.**',\n",
       " '- **Integrate AI systems in the public sector**\\n**in a structural manner with a changing**\\n**mindsets approach to public administration.**\\n\\n\\n1 Given the continuing advances in technology, Artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a system to identify, interpret, make inferences and learn from\\n\\ndata to achieve predetermined organizational and societal goals (Mikalef and Gupta, 2021).\\n\\n2 The objective of this Policy Brief is to foster interest and draw attention to the opportunities for AI adoption within the public sector to create public value. While AI\\n\\nregulation is an important consideration, this issue is not directly addressed here.\\n\\n\\n1',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\nNotwithstanding the recent advances in AI, including\\nthe release of generative AI and the opportunities to\\nfoster AI innovation within public sector\\n\\norganizations, governments are challenged “to ensure\\nthat AI is adopted effectively for the public good”\\n(Hankins et al., 2023, p. 4). It remains to be seen what\\neffect AI will have on responsibilities and public\\nvalues upheld by governments.\\n\\nPublic value management has emerged as a leading\\npublic management paradigm in the post-traditional\\nbureaucracy and new public management (NPM)\\ngovernance models era. It is based on the democratic\\nprocess to explain the undergirding of public action\\nand to mitigate failures of the previous models in the\\npublic sector. In this regard, public value does not\\nonly focus on efficiency and goal achievement, but\\nalso emphasizes the fulfilment of societal\\n\\nexpectations and publicly-held values, including\\nequity, transparency, and responsiveness, by taking\\ninto consideration citizens’ preferences. Within the\\ncontext of public administration and policy, this\\nparadigm is critical for public sector administrators. In\\nparticular, public sector administrators strategically\\ncreate public value through a heightened emphasis on\\ndemocratic and collaborative governance and\\n\\ncitizenship to deliver quality public services (Moore,\\n1995; O’Flynn, 2007; Benington, 2009; Bojang,\\n2020). Thus, the government has a special role as\\nguarantor of public values, that is, going beyond\\nmerely being the supervisor and provider of services\\nto the public to value creation in the public sector.\\n\\nTherefore, in light of the growing emphasis for\\ngovernments to employ AI-enabled services, it is\\ncritical that the needs of citizens, as the primary\\nbeneficiaries of public services, remain paramount\\nwhile harnessing the potential of artificial\\n\\nintelligence. Within this context, if public sector\\norganizations are to fully harness the power of AI to\\ndeliver more efficient, inclusive and transparent\\nservices to citizens, it is important to clearly\\nunderstand the challenges of AI and avoid potential\\npitfalls by implementing appropriate mitigation\\nstrategies. To that end, this policy brief explores the\\ninterconnections between the deployment of artificial\\nintelligence within the public sector and public value\\ncreation, and proposes a framework for assessing the\\neffectiveness of AI adoption in the public sector and\\nits potential for public value creation.',\n",
       " '### Unlocking the potential value of artificial intelligence in the public sector\\n\\nWith the expansion of digital government, artificial\\nintelligence and the collection and analysis of big\\ndata are set to make the public sector organizations\\nleaner with increased levels of efficiency and\\nresponsiveness to the needs of citizens, all the while\\nstrengthening bureaucracy’s core purpose. With the\\nintroduction of AI-technologies in government\\npublic-sector ecosystems, traditional approaches to\\nservice provision, policymaking and enforcement\\ncan change rapidly. In addition, the public\\ngovernance implications for AI use in government\\ncan be varied. In this regard, the rise of AI use in\\ngovernment, together with the increased level of\\nsophistication of these applications has triggered\\nseveral public governance questions.\\n\\nTraditional approaches to service delivery have been\\nrapidly changing. Globally, AI has been used to\\nimprove the quality of services, foster the trust of\\ncitizens, as well as increase service delivery\\nefficiency and effectiveness. Altogether, proactive\\ngovernments have achieved greater levels of accurate\\nforecasting and enhanced levels of policymaking, as\\nvalue has been created in various functional areas,\\nincluding “decision support, transportation, public\\nhealth and law enforcement” (Zuiderwijk, et al., 2021).\\n\\nNotwithstanding, the use of AI within the public\\nsector can create some challenges and considerations\\nwhich must be addressed. At the core, it is critical\\nthat the adoption of AI in the public sector advances\\nthe public good. In this regard, to ensure citizens’\\nconfidence, the use of this technology must be\\ntransparent and predictable, such that the outcomes\\nare inclusive, fair, free of bias, and adhere to societal\\nconcerns for citizen privacy, safety, and trust.\\n\\nAdopting new technologies can be one of the main\\napproaches for transforming governments. However,\\npublic administrations, in today’s increasingly dataintensive environment, have at times failed to deliver\\nflagship policies that are reliant on information and\\ncommunications technologies (ICTs). New theories',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\nand conceptual frameworks are required to\\nunderstand and adopt the latest technology to realize\\nthe promise of fundamentally transforming government.\\nIn the case of AI, a critical challenge to its adoption\\nin the public sector is the need to ensure the\\nprotection of public interest, notwithstanding the\\nvelocity at which the system is evolving.\\n\\nThe November 2022 release of ChatGPT-3\\nrepresented a major tipping point in AI development,\\nwhich repositioned AI from being a tool for software\\ndevelopers, to a “consumer-focused” tool that everyone\\ncould use without needing technical expertise. Within\\nfour months of that release, GPT-4 was unveiled,\\nwhich exponentially expanded the processing\\ncapability of this system to enable it to exhibit humanlevel performance. In two months, the website had\\ngarnered over 100 million users, making it the fastestgrowing website in history (Wheeler, 2023).\\n\\nAt this pace, and with the introduction of new\\ntechnology players into the global AI race, existing\\nrules and legal guardrails can be woefully\\ninsufficient to deal with the velocity of AI\\ndevelopments. These guardrails, which were predicated\\non regulatory assumptions for expanding the\\nphysical power of humans, lack the focus and agility\\nto be meaningful for artificial intelligence and its\\naugmenting of cognitive power. This can have direct\\nconsequences for the regulatory considerations of\\nprivacy, competition, manipulation and misinformation,\\nparticularly given that the accuracy of AI models\\nincreases with the expansion of the data on which it\\nis trained. In this regard, traversing the regulatory\\ntightrope in the AI era between protecting public\\ninterest and promoting innovation and investment\\nrequires a multi-layered analysis for AI that\\ntakes cognizance of the varied use cases and\\ntheir accompanying applications, adoptions and\\ninherent risks.\\n\\nIn the hope of making government services more\\neffective and responsive, public sector agencies have\\nbegun to deploy AI applications that implement\\ngovernment policies. However, thanks to their selflearning and adaptive capabilities, AI systems have',\n",

The\\nadoption of these systems within public agencies\\nwould necessitate embedding operational procedures\\nthat articulate epistemic criteria that are aligned with\\nsocietal norms and concerns to mitigate humancentric rational thinking being substituted by an\\nalgorithmic reality that is intractable, impenetrable\\nand incontestable.\\n\\n### Artificial intelligence government readiness\\n\\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to transform\\nthe public sector by increasing institutional\\nproductivity and providing higher quality of services\\nto citizens.

In October 2023, the Dominican Republic\\nbecame the first country in the subregion to release its\\nstrategy (Government of Dominican Republic, 2023).\\nOther countries are at various stages of articulating\\ntheir vision and national strategy for artificial\\nintelligence, with Oxford Insights reporting\\n\\nindications of forthcoming strategies from Cuba and\\nJamaica.

However, one of the\\nfactors hindering progress is the lack of humanrelated AI capability within public organizations.\\nBoth technical and non-technical human skillsets are\\nrequired for the successful implementation of AI in\\nthe public sector. Mikalef et al. (2023) define AI\\ncapability as the innovation needed to uptake\\nartificial intelligence. The mere existence of AI\\nwithin a public administration does not necessarily\\ncreate public value. The ability to deploy AI\\nsolutions that improve quality and efficiency requires\\ninternal competencies which transcend the\\n\\nmotivation to use AI technologies. To derive value\\nfrom AI technologies, not only do AI systems have\\nto be successfully developed and deployed, they\\nmust also be integrated into the organization in a\\nstructural manner and with a changing mindsets\\napproach to public administration. AI competencies\\nare not only required of public administrators and\\nmanagers. Rather, every public servant must have\\nsome form of AI-related competencies, enabling\\nthem to find new ways of working with AI systems,\\nchanging traditional work procedures, as well as their\\nattitudes, to embrace new technologies to achieve\\nimproved outcomes.\\n\\nThe adoption of AI in the public sector is\\ntransformative and will affect the domestic labour\\nmarket and educational institutions with the need for\\nreskilling and upskilling of competencies to ensure\\ncontinued employability within an AI-enabled public\\nsector. In this regard, the current labour force would\\nneed to possess unique tools and capabilities to\\nsucceed in a future with AI. New skillsets are\\nrequired, particularly taking into consideration that\\nseveral jobs and occupations in the public sector will\\nbe at risk of being automated. In this regard, it would\\nbe critical for government to adopt the role of enabler,\\nproviding the requisite political commitment and\\nfunding to ensure that training institutions are able to',\n",

In this\\nregard, a core mission of the school system would\\nhave to be lifelong learning to ensure continuous\\nadaptation to the knowledge requirements of\\nemerging technologies. In Malta, for example, not\\nonly does the national AI strategy recognize the need\\nfor teaching 21st-century skills throughout the\\neducation process, starting early on in childhood; it\\nalso sets out the government strategy for increasing\\nthe number of qualified AI specialists, which\\nincludes providing scholarships and financial\\nsupport for post-graduate studies in AI, including tax\\ncredits (Malta, 2019).\\n\\n### Harnessing the potential  of artificial intelligence\\n\\nWithin the public sector, the creation of public value\\nintersects multiple domains. From the managerial\\nmodel, public administrators emphasize economic\\nand administrative logics of optimization to achieve\\nefficiency and productivity gains. As shown in\\ndiagram 2, in the case of the democratic and citizen\\nmodel, the emphasis is on ensuring that public\\nservices are delivered to address the needs of citizens,\\nincluding the need for ethical and transparent\\nresponsiveness, and accountability. Within this\\nframework, it remains that the adoption of AI within\\nthe public sector, with its transformative qualities,\\nshould continue to advance public value creation.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nDiagram 2: Framework for assessing the effectiveness of artificial intelligence on public value creation\\n\\n\\n![](./images/the-potential-of-artificial-intelligence-to-create-public-value.pdf-5-0.png)\\n\\nSource: Adapted from Amrani et al., 2022.',\n",
