    "# Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python 3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended ways to install Python 3.12 are using a version manager like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):** It is also a package manager like npm, and faster than pip or poetry. Recommended.\n",
    "- **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html):** Supports other languages as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uv is installed, you can install Python 3.12 using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv python install 3.12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start a UV project\n",
    "\n",
    "Using uv you can use it to manage your project dependencies as well. First you create a new project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This add a pyproject.toml file, similar to a package.json file in a Node.js project. Better than manually maintaining a requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a virtual environment using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv venv # this prints out how to activate the virtual environment\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate[.fish] # activate the virtual environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus all your dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, finally, we can install our first dependency, Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv add jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a great tool for experimentation and learning. [VS Code extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) is also available for Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice talk about why an interactive environment like Jupyter is important: [Literate Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX1yGxJijsI)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launch VS Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "code .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code will begin inside the virtual environment, with access to libraries installed in it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## And jump into the data preparation -> text extraction part:\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMuPDF is a fast text extraction library for python, it is open source with an AGPL 3.0 license. Other alternatives you should look at are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) from IBM.\n",

    "- [MoondreamAI](https://github.com/vikhyat/moondream) plus PyMuPDF image extraction to add captions to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to add our second dependency, [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/):\n",

The first, Parts 1–7, contains rules that affect all competitors. The second, the appendices, provides details of rules, rules that apply to particular kinds of racing, and rules that affect only a small number of competitors or officials.\\n\\n Terminology  A term used in the sense stated in the Definitions is printed in italics or, in preambles, in bold italics (for example, racing and racing).\\n\\n Each of the terms in the table below is used in The Racing Rules of Sailing with the meaning given.\\n\\n Term Meaning\\n Boat A sailboat and the crew on board.\\n Competitor A person who races or intends to race in the event.\\n National A World Sailing member national authority. authority\\n Race The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) committee and any other person or committee performing a\\n race committee function.\\n Racing rule A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.\\n Technical The technical committee appointed under rule committee 89.2(c) and any other person or committee\\n performing a technical committee function. \\n Vessel Any boat or ship.\\n\\n Other words and terms are used in the sense ordinarily understood in nautical or general use. \\n\\n Hails  A language other than English may be used for a hail required by the rules provided that it is reasonable for it to be understood by all boats affected. However, a hail in English is always acceptable.\\n\\n Notation  The notation ‘[DP]’ in a rule means that the penalty for a breach of the rule may, at the discretion of the protest committee, be less than disqualification. Guidelines for discretionary penalties are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n|Term|Meaning|\\n|---|---|\\n|Boat|A sailboat and the crew on board.|\\n|Competitor|A person who races or intends to race in the event.|\\n|National authority|A World Sailing member national authority.|\\n|Race committee|The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a race committee function.|\\n|Racing rule|A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.|\\n|Technical committee|The technical committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a technical committee function.|\\n|Vessel|Any boat or ship.|\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Revision  The racing rules are revised and published every four years by World Sailing, the international authority for the sport. This edition becomes effective on 1 January 2021 except that for an event beginning in 2020 the date may be postponed by the notice of race or sailing instructions. Marginal markings indicate important changes to Parts 1–7 and the Definitions in the 2017–2020 edition. No changes are contemplated before 2025, but any changes determined to be urgent before then will be announced through national authorities and posted on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Appendices  When the rules of an appendix apply, they take precedence over any conflicting rules in Parts 1–7 and the Definitions. Each appendix is identified by a letter. A reference to a rule in an appendix will contain the letter and the rule number (for example, ‘rule A1’). The letters I, O and Q are not used to designate appendices in this book.\\n\\n World Sailing Regulations  The Regulations are referred to in the definition Rule and in rule 6, but they are not included in this book because they can be changed at any time. The most recent versions of the Regulations are published on the World Sailing website; new versions will be announced through national authorities.\\n\\n Interpretations  World Sailing publishes the following authoritative interpretations of the racing rules: \\n\\n • The Case Book – Interpretations of the Racing Rules,\\n\\n • The Call Books, for various disciplines,\\n\\n • Interpretations of Rule 42, Propulsion, and\\n\\n • Interpretations of the Regulations, for those Regulations that\\n are rules. \\n These publications are available on the World Sailing website. Other interpretations of the racing rules are not authoritative unless approved by World Sailing in accordance with Regulation 28.4. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### DEFINITIONS\\n\\n###### A term used as stated below is shown in italic type or, in preambles, in bold italic type. The meaning of several other terms is given in Terminology in the Introduction.\\n\\n Abandon  A race that a race committee or protest committee abandons is void but may be resailed.\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One boat is clear astern of another when her hull and equipment in normal position are behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other boat’s hull and equipment in normal position. The other boat is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a boat between them overlaps both. These terms always apply to boats on the same tack. They apply to boats on opposite tacks only when rule 18 applies between them or when both boats are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Conflict of Interest  A person has a conflict of interest if he\\n\\n (a) may gain or lose as a result of a decision to which he contributes,\\n\\n (b) may reasonably appear to have a personal or financial interest which could affect his ability to be impartial, or \\n\\n (c) has a close personal interest in a decision. \\n\\n Fetching A boat is fetching a mark when she is in a position to pass to windward of it and leave it on the required side without changing tack.\\n\\n Finish A boat finishes when, after starting, any part of her hull crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or \\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course. \\n\\n Keep Clear  A boat keeps clear of a right-of-way boat\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way boat can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and, \\n\\n (b) when the boats are overlapped, if the right-of-way boat can also change course in both directions without immediately making contact.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Leeward and Windward  A boat’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her mainsail lies. The other side is her windward side. When two boats on the same tack overlap, the one on the leeward side of the other is the leeward boat. The other is the windward boat.\\n\\n Mark  An object the sailing instructions require a boat to leave on a specified side, a race committee vessel surrounded by navigable water from which the starting or finishing line extends, and an object intentionally attached to the object or vessel. However, an anchor line is not part of the mark. \\n\\n Mark-Room  Room for a boat to leave a mark on the required side. Also,\\n\\n (a) room to sail to the mark when her proper course is to sail close to it, and\\n\\n (b) room to round or pass the mark as necessary to sail the course without touching the mark. \\n\\n However, mark-room for a boat does not include room to tack unless she is overlapped inside and to windward of the boat required to give mark-room and she would be fetching the mark after her tack.\\n\\n Obstruction  An object that a boat could not pass without changing course substantially, if she were sailing directly towards it and one of her hull lengths from it. An object that can be safely passed on only one side and an object, area or line so designated by the sailing instructions are also obstructions. However, a boat racing is not an obstruction to other boats unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. A vessel under way, including a boat racing, is never a continuing obstruction.\\n\\n Overlap  See Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap.\\n\\n Party  A party to a hearing is\\n\\n (a) for a protest hearing: a protestor, a protestee;\\n\\n (b) for a redress hearing: a boat requesting redress or for which redress is requested; a boat for which a hearing is called to consider redress under rule 60.3(b); a race committee acting under rule 60.2(b); a technical committee acting under rule 60.4(b); \\n\\n (c) for a redress hearing under rule 62.1(a): the body alleged to have made an improper action or omission; \\n\\n (d) a person against whom an allegation of a breach of rule 69.1(a) is made; a person presenting an allegation under rule 69.2(e)(1); \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (e) a support person subject to a hearing under rule 60.3(d) or 69; any boat that person supports; a person appointed to present an allegation under rule 60.3(d). \\n\\n However, the protest committee is never a party.\\n\\n Postpone  A postponed race is delayed before its scheduled start but may be started or abandoned later.\\n\\n Proper Course  A course a boat would choose in order to sail the course and finish as soon as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to in the rule using the term. A boat has no proper course before her starting signal.\\n\\n Protest  An allegation made under rule 61.2 by a boat, a race committee, a technical committee or a protest committee that a boat has broken a rule.\\n\\n Racing  A boat is racing from her preparatory signal until she finishes and clears the finishing line and marks or retires, or until the race committee signals a general recall, postponement or abandonment.\\n\\n Room  The space a boat needs in the existing conditions, including space to comply with her obligations under the rules of Part 2 and rule 31, while manoeuvring promptly in a seamanlike way.\\n\\n Rule\\n\\n (a) The rules in this book, including the Definitions, Race Signals, Introduction, preambles and the rules of relevant appendices, but not titles;\\n\\n (b) World Sailing Regulations that have been designated by World Sailing as having the status of a rule and are published on the World Sailing website; \\n\\n (c) the prescriptions of the national authority, unless they are changed by the notice of race or sailing instructions in compliance with the national authority’s prescription, if any, to rule 88.2; \\n\\n (d) the class rules (for a boat racing under a handicap or rating system, the rules of that system are ‘class rules’);\\n\\n (e) the notice of race;\\n\\n (f) the sailing instructions; and\\n\\n (g) any other documents that govern the event.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Sail the Course A boat sails the course provided that a string representing her track from the time she begins to approach the starting line from its pre- start side to start until she finishes, when drawn taut,\\n\\n (a) passes each mark of the course for the race on the required side and in the correct order, \\n\\n (b) touches each mark designated in the sailing instructions to be a rounding mark, and \\n\\n (c) passes between the marks of a gate from the direction of the course from the previous mark. \\n\\n Start  A boat starts when, her hull having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, and having complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, any part of her hull crosses the starting line from the pre-start side to the course side. \\n\\n Support Person  Any person who\\n\\n (a) provides, or may provide, physical or advisory support to a competitor, including any coach, trainer, manager, team staff, medic, paramedic or any other person working with, treating or assisting a competitor in or preparing for the competition, or\\n\\n (b) is the parent or guardian of a competitor. \\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port  A boat is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to her windward side.\\n\\n Windward See Leeward and Windward.\\n\\n Zone  The area around a mark within a distance of three hull lengths of the boat nearer to it. A boat is in the zone when any part of her hull is in the zone.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### BASIC PRINCIPLES\\n\\n###### SPORTSMANSHIP AND THE RULES\\n\\n Competitors in the sport of sailing are governed by a body of rules that they are expected to follow and enforce. A fundamental principle of sportsmanship is that when a boat breaks a rule and is not exonerated she will promptly take an appropriate penalty or action, which may be to retire.\\n ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\n Participants are encouraged to minimize any adverse environmental impact of the sport of sailing.\\n PART 1 \\n\\n#### FUNDAMENTAL RULES\\n\\n###### 1 SAFETY\\n\\n 1.1 Helping Those in Danger\\n\\n A boat, competitor or support person shall give all possible help to any person or vessel in danger.\\n\\n 1.2 Life-Saving Equipment and Personal Flotation Devices\\n\\n A boat shall carry adequate life-saving equipment for all persons on board, including one item ready for immediate use, unless her class rules make some other provision. Each competitor is individually responsible for wearing a personal flotation device adequate for the conditions.\\n\\n 2 FAIR SAILING\\n\\n A boat and her owner shall compete in compliance with recognized principles of sportsmanship and fair play. A boat may be penalized under this rule only if it is clearly established that these principles have been violated. The penalty shall be a disqualification that is not excludable. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 3 DECISION TO RACE\\n\\n The responsibility for a boat’s decision to participate in a race or to continue racing is hers alone.\\n\\n 4 ACCEPTANCE OF THE RULES\\n\\n 4.1 (a) By participating or intending to participate in an event conducted under the rules, each competitor and boat owner agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n (b) A support person by providing support, or a parent or guardian by permitting their child to enter an event, agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n 4.2 Each competitor and boat owner agrees, on behalf of their support persons, that such support persons are bound by the rules.\\n\\n 4.3 Acceptance of the rules includes agreement\\n\\n (a) to be governed by the rules;\\n\\n (b) to accept the penalties imposed and other action taken under the rules, subject to the appeal and review procedures provided in them, as the final determination of any matter arising under the rules;\\n\\n (c) with respect to any such determination, not to resort to any court of law or tribunal not provided for in the rules; and\\n\\n (d) by each competitor and boat owner to ensure that their support persons are aware of the rules.\\n\\n 4.4 The person in charge of each boat shall ensure that all competitors in the crew and the boat’s owner are aware of their responsibilities under this rule.\\n\\n 4.5 This rule may be changed by a prescription of the national authority of the venue. \\n\\n 5 RULES GOVERNING ORGANIZING AUTHORITIES  AND OFFICIALS\\n\\n The organizing authority, race committee, technical committee, protest committee and other race officials shall be governed by the rules in the conduct and judging of the event.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 6 WORLD SAILING REGULATIONS\\n\\n 6.1 Each competitor, boat owner and support person shall comply with the World Sailing Regulations that have been designated by World Sailing as having the status of a rule. These regulations as of 30 June 2020 are the World Sailing: \\n\\n ● Advertising Code\\n\\n ● Anti-Doping Code\\n\\n ● Betting and Anti-Corruption Code\\n\\n ● Disciplinary Code\\n\\n ● Eligibility Code\\n\\n ● Sailor Categorization Code \\n\\n 6.2 Rule 63.1 does not apply unless protests are permitted in the Regulation alleged to have been broken. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 2\\n#### WHEN BOATS MEET\\n\\n###### The rules of Part 2 apply between boats that are sailing in or near the racing area and intend to race, are racing, or have been racing. However, a boat not racing shall not be penalized for breaking one of these rules, except rule 14 when the incident resulted in injury or serious damage, or rule 23.1.\\n\\n When a boat sailing under these rules meets a vessel that is not, she shall comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS) or government right-of-way rules. If the notice of race so states, the rules of Part 2 are replaced by the right- of-way rules of the IRPCAS or by government right-of-way rules.\\n\\n SECTION A RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n A boat has right of way over another boat when the other boat is required to keep clear of her. However, some rules in Sections B, C and D limit the actions of a right-of-way boat.\\n\\n 10 ON OPPOSITE TACKS\\n\\n When boats are on opposite tacks, a port-tack boat shall keep clear of a starboard-tack boat.\\n\\n 11 ON THE SAME TACK, OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and overlapped, a windward boat shall keep clear of a leeward boat.\\n\\n 12 ON THE SAME TACK, NOT OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and not overlapped, a boat clear astern shall keep clear of a boat clear ahead.\\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n After a boat passes head to wind, she shall keep clear of other boats until she is on a close-hauled course. During that time rules 10, 11 and\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 12 do not apply. If two boats are subject to this rule at the same time, the one on the other’s port side or the one astern shall keep clear.\\n\\n SECTION B GENERAL LIMITATIONS\\n\\n 14 AVOIDING CONTACT\\n\\n A boat shall avoid contact with another boat if reasonably possible. However, a right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark- room to which she is entitled, need not act to avoid contact until it is clear that the other boat is not keeping clear or giving room or mark- room. \\n\\n 15 ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n When a boat acquires right of way, she shall initially give the other boat room to keep clear, unless she acquires right of way because of the other boat’s actions.\\n\\n 16 CHANGING COURSE\\n\\n 16.1 When a right-of-way boat changes course, she shall give the other boat room to keep clear.\\n\\n 16.2 In addition, on a beat to windward when a port-tack boat is keeping clear by sailing to pass to leeward of a starboard-tack boat, the starboard-tack boat shall not bear away if as a result the port-tack boat must change course immediately to continue keeping clear. \\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK; PROPER COURSE\\n\\n If a boat clear astern becomes overlapped within two of her hull lengths to leeward of a boat on the same tack, she shall not sail above her proper course while they remain on the same tack and overlapped within that distance, unless in doing so she promptly sails astern of the other boat. This rule does not apply if the overlap begins while the windward boat is required by rule 13 to keep clear.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### SECTION C AT MARKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n Section C rules do not apply at a starting mark surrounded by navigable water or at its anchor line from the time boats are approaching them to start until they have passed them.\\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n 18.1 When Rule 18 Applies\\n\\n Rule 18 applies between boats when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is in the zone. However, it does not apply\\n\\n (a) between boats on opposite tacks on a beat to windward,\\n\\n (b) between boats on opposite tacks when the proper course at the mark for one but not both of them is to tack,\\n\\n (c) between a boat approaching a mark and one leaving it, or\\n\\n (d) if the mark is a continuing obstruction, in which case rule 19 applies.\\n\\n Rule 18 no longer applies between boats when mark-room has been given. \\n\\n 18.2 Giving Mark-Room\\n\\n (a) When boats are overlapped the outside boat shall give the inside boat mark-room, unless rule 18.2(b) applies.\\n\\n (b) If boats are overlapped when the first of them reaches the zone, the outside boat at that moment shall thereafter give the inside boat mark-room. If a boat is clear ahead when she reaches the zone, the boat clear astern at that moment shall thereafter give her mark-room.\\n\\n (c) When a boat is required to give mark-room by rule 18.2(b),\\n\\n (1) she shall continue to do so even if later an overlap is broken or a new overlap begins;\\n\\n (2) if she becomes overlapped inside the boat entitled to mark- room, she shall also give that boat room to sail her proper course while they remain overlapped.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (d) Rules 18.2(b) and (c) cease to apply if the boat entitled to mark- room passes head to wind or leaves the zone. \\n\\n (e) If there is reasonable doubt that a boat obtained or broke an overlap in time, it shall be presumed that she did not.\\n\\n (f) If a boat obtained an inside overlap from clear astern or by tacking to windward of the other boat and, from the time the overlap began, the outside boat has been unable to give mark- room, she is not required to give it.\\n\\n 18.3 Passing Head to Wind in the Zone\\n\\n If a boat in the zone of a mark to be left to port passes head to wind from port to starboard tack and is then fetching the mark, she shall not cause a boat that has been on starboard tack since entering the zone to sail above close-hauled to avoid contact and she shall give mark-room if that boat becomes overlapped inside her. When this rule applies between boats, rule 18.2 does not apply between them. \\n\\n 18.4 Gybing\\n\\n When an inside overlapped right-of-way boat must gybe at a mark to sail her proper course, until she gybes she shall sail no farther from the mark than needed to sail that course. Rule 18.4 does not apply at a gate mark.\\n\\n 19 ROOM TO PASS AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n 19.1 When Rule 19 Applies\\n\\n Rule 19 applies between two boats at an obstruction except \\n\\n (a) when the obstruction is a mark the boats are required to leave on the same side, or\\n\\n (b) when rule 18 applies between the boats and the obstruction is another boat overlapped with each of them. \\n\\n However, at a continuing obstruction, rule 19 always applies and rule 18 does not.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 19.2 Giving Room at an Obstruction\\n\\n (a) A right-of-way boat may choose to pass an obstruction on either side.\\n\\n (b) When boats are overlapped, the outside boat shall give the inside boat room between her and the obstruction, unless she has been unable to do so from the time the overlap began.\\n\\n (c) While boats are passing a continuing obstruction, if a boat that was clear astern and required to keep clear becomes overlapped between the other boat and the obstruction and, at the moment the overlap begins, there is not room for her to pass between them, \\n\\n (1) she is not entitled to room under rule 19.2(b), and\\n\\n (2) while the boats remain overlapped, she shall keep clear and rules 10 and 11 do not apply. \\n\\n 20 ROOM TO TACK AT AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n 20.1 Hailing\\n\\n A boat may hail for room to tack and avoid a boat on the same tack. However, she shall not hail unless\\n\\n (a) she is approaching an obstruction and will soon need to make a substantial course change to avoid it safely, and\\n\\n (b) she is sailing close-hauled or above.\\n\\n In addition, she shall not hail if the obstruction is a mark and a boat that is fetching it would be required to change course as a result of the hail.\\n\\n 20.2 Responding\\n\\n (a) After a boat hails, she shall give a hailed boat time to respond.\\n\\n (b) A hailed boat shall respond even if the hail breaks rule 20.1.\\n\\n (c) A hailed boat shall respond either by tacking as soon as possible, or by immediately replying ‘You tack’ and then giving the hailing boat room to tack and avoid her.\\n\\n (d) When a hailed boat responds, the hailing boat shall tack as soon as possible.\\n\\n (e) From the time a boat hails until she has tacked and avoided a hailed boat, rule 18.2 does not apply between them.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 20.3 Passing On a Hail to an Additional Boat\\n\\n When a boat has been hailed for room to tack and she intends to respond by tacking, she may hail another boat on the same tack for room to tack and avoid her. She may hail even if her hail does not meet the conditions of rule 20.1. Rule 20.2 applies between her and a boat she hails. \\n\\n 20.4 Additional Requirements for Hails\\n\\n (a) When conditions are such that a hail may not be heard, the boat shall also make a signal that clearly indicates her need for room to tack or her response.\\n\\n (b) The notice of race may specify an alternative communication for a boat to indicate her need for room to tack or her response, and require boats to use it. \\n\\n SECTION D  OTHER RULES\\n\\n When rule 21 or 22 applies between two boats, Section A rules do not.\\n\\n 21 STARTING ERRORS; TAKING PENALTIES;  BACKING A SAIL \\n\\n 21.1 A boat sailing towards the pre-start side of the starting line or one of its extensions after her starting signal to start or to comply with rule 30.1 shall keep clear of a boat not doing so until her hull is completely on the pre-start side.\\n\\n 21.2 A boat taking a penalty shall keep clear of one that is not.\\n\\n 21.3 A boat moving astern, or sideways to windward, through the water by backing a sail shall keep clear of one that is not.\\n\\n 22 CAPSIZED, ANCHORED OR AGROUND; RESCUING\\n\\n If possible, a boat shall avoid a boat that is capsized or has not regained control after capsizing, is anchored or aground, or is trying to help a person or vessel in danger. A boat is capsized when her masthead is in the water.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 23 INTERFERING WITH ANOTHER BOAT\\n\\n 23.1 If reasonably possible, a boat not racing shall not interfere with a boat that is racing.\\n\\n 23.2 If reasonably possible, a boat shall not interfere with a boat that is taking a penalty, sailing on another leg or subject to rule 21.1. However, after the starting signal this rule does not apply when the boat is sailing her proper course. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 3\\n#### CONDUCT OF A RACE\\n\\n###### 25 NOTICE OF RACE, SAILING INSTRUCTIONS  AND SIGNALS\\n\\n 25.1 The notice of race shall be made available to each boat that enters an event before she enters. The sailing instructions shall be made available to each boat before a race begins. \\n\\n 25.2 The meanings of the visual and sound signals stated in Race Signals shall not be changed except under rule 86.1(b). The meanings of any other signals that may be used shall be stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions. \\n\\n 25.3 When the race committee is required to display a flag as a visual signal, it may use a flag or other object of a similar appearance. \\n\\n 26 STARTING RACES\\n\\n Races shall be started by using the following signals. Times shall be taken from the visual signals; the absence of a sound signal shall be disregarded.\\n\\n\\n###### Minutes before\\n starting signal\\n\\n\\n###### Visual signal Sound signal\\n\\n\\n###### Means\\n\\n\\n######  5* Class flag One Warning signal\\n\\n\\n###### 4 P, I, Z, Z with I, U, or black flag \\n 1 Preparatory flag removed\\n 0 Class flag removed\\n\\n\\n###### One Preparatory signal\\n\\n One long One minute\\n\\n One Starting signal\\n\\n\\n###### *or as stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions\\n\\n The warning signal for each succeeding class shall be made with or after the starting signal of the preceding class.\\n\\n 27 OTHER RACE COMMITTEE ACTIONS BEFORE  THE STARTING SIGNAL\\n\\n 27.1 No later than the warning signal, the race committee shall signal or otherwise designate the course to be sailed if the sailing instructions\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### have not stated the course, and it may replace one course signal with another and signal that wearing personal flotation devices is required (display flag Y with one sound).\\n\\n 27.2 No later than the preparatory signal, the race committee may move a starting mark.\\n\\n 27.3 Before the starting signal, the race committee may for any reason postpone (display flag AP, AP over H, or AP over A, with two sounds) or abandon the race (display flag N over H, or N over A, with three sounds).\\n\\n 28 SAILING THE RACE \\n 28.1 A boat shall start, sail the course and then finish. While doing so, she may leave on either side a mark that does not begin, bound or end the leg she is sailing. After finishing she need not cross the finishing line completely.\\n\\n 28.2 A boat may correct any errors in sailing the course, provided she has not crossed the finishing line to finish.\\n\\n 29 RECALLS\\n\\n 29.1 Individual Recall\\n\\n When at a boat’s starting signal any part of her hull is on the course side of the starting line or she must comply with rule 30.1, the race committee shall promptly display flag X with one sound. The flag shall be displayed until the hull of each such boat has been completely on the pre-start side of the starting line or one of its extensions, and until all such boats have complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, but no later than four minutes after the starting signal or one minute before any later starting signal, whichever is earlier. If rule 29.2, 30.3 or 30.4 applies this rule does not.\\n\\n 29.2 General Recall\\n\\n When at the starting signal the race committee is unable to identify boats that are on the course side of the starting line or to which rule 30 applies, or there has been an error in the starting procedure, the race committee may signal a general recall (display the First Substitute with two sounds). The warning signal for a new start for the recalled class shall be made one minute after the First Substitute is removed (one\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### sound), and the starts for any succeeding classes shall follow the new start.\\n\\n 30 STARTING PENALTIES\\n\\n 30.1 I Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag I has been displayed, and any part of a boat’s hull is on the course side of the starting line or one of its extensions during the last minute before her starting signal, she shall sail across an extension so that her hull is completely on the pre-start side before she starts. \\n\\n 30.2 Z Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag Z has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall receive, without a hearing, a 20% Scoring Penalty calculated as stated in rule 44.3(c). She shall be penalized even if the race is restarted or resailed, but not if it is postponed or abandoned before the starting signal. If she is similarly identified during a subsequent attempt to start the same race, she shall receive an additional 20% Scoring Penalty.\\n\\n 30.3 U Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag U has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall be disqualified without a hearing, but not if the race is restarted or resailed. \\n\\n 30.4 Black Flag Rule\\n\\n If a black flag has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall be disqualified without a hearing, even if the race is restarted or resailed, but not if it is postponed or abandoned before the starting signal. If a general recall is signalled or the race is abandoned after the starting signal, the race committee shall display her sail number before the next warning signal for that race, and if the race is restarted or resailed she shall not sail in it. If she does so, her disqualification shall not be excluded in calculating her series score.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 31 TOUCHING A MARK\\n\\n While racing, a boat shall not touch a starting mark before starting, a mark that begins, bounds or ends the leg of the course on which she is sailing, or a finishing mark after finishing.\\n\\n 32 SHORTENING OR ABANDONING AFTER THE START\\n\\n 32.1 After the starting signal, the race committee may shorten the course (display flag S with two sounds) or abandon the race (display flag N, N over H, or N over A, with three sounds), \\n\\n (a) because of foul weather,\\n\\n (b) because of insufficient wind making it unlikely that any boat will finish within the race time limit,\\n\\n (c) because a mark is missing or out of position, or\\n\\n (d) for any other reason directly affecting the safety or fairness of the competition.\\n\\n In addition, the race committee may shorten the course so that other scheduled races can be sailed, or abandon the race because of an error in the starting procedure. However, after one boat has started, sailed the course and finished within the race time limit, if any, the race committee shall not abandon the race without considering the consequences for all boats in the race or series. \\n\\n 32.2 If the race committee signals a shortened course (displays flag S with two sounds), the finishing line shall be,\\n\\n (a) at a rounding mark, between the mark and a staff displaying flag S;\\n\\n (b) a line the course requires boats to cross; or \\n\\n (c) at a gate, between the gate marks.\\n\\n The shortened course shall be signalled before the first boat crosses the finishing line.\\n\\n 33 CHANGING THE NEXT LEG OF THE COURSE \\n\\n While boats are racing, the race committee may change a leg of the course that begins at a rounding mark or at a gate by changing the position of the next mark (or the finishing line) and signalling all boats before they begin the leg. The next mark need not be in position at that time.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (a) If the direction of the leg will be changed, the signal shall be the display of flag C with repetitive sounds and one or both of (1) the new compass bearing,\\n (2) a green triangle for a change to starboard or a red rectangle for a change to port.\\n (b) If the length of the leg will be changed, the signal shall be the display of flag C with repetitive sounds and a ‘–’ if the length will be decreased or a ‘+’ if it will be increased.\\n (c) Subsequent legs may be changed without further signalling to maintain the course shape.\\n\\n 34 MARK MISSING If a mark is missing or out of position while boats are racing, the race committee shall, if possible,  (a) replace it in its correct position or substitute a new one of similar appearance, or\\n (b) substitute an object displaying flag M and make repetitive sound signals.\\n\\n 35 RACE TIME LIMIT AND SCORES If one boat starts, sails the course and finishes within the time limit for that race, if any, all boats that finish shall be scored according to their finishing places unless the race is abandoned. If no boat finishes within the race time limit, the race committee shall abandon the race. \\n\\n 36 RACES RESTARTED OR RESAILED If a race is restarted or resailed, a breach of a rule in the original race, or in any previous restart or resail of that race, shall not  (a) prohibit a boat from competing unless she has broken rule 30.4; or\\n (b) cause a boat to be penalized except under rule 2, 30.2, 30.4 or 69 or under rule 14 when she has caused injury or serious damage. \\n\\n 37 SEARCH AND RESCUE INSTRUCTIONS When the race committee displays flag V with one sound, all boats and official and support vessels shall, if possible, monitor the race committee communication channel for search and rescue instructions. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n PART 4\\n\\n#### OTHER REQUIREMENTS  WHEN RACING\\n\\n###### Part 4 rules apply only to boats racing unless the rule states otherwise. \\n\\n SECTION A GENERAL REQUIREMENTS \\n\\n 40 PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES \\n\\n 40.1 Basic Rule\\n\\n When rule 40.1 is made applicable by rule 40.2, each competitor shall wear a personal flotation device except briefly while changing or adjusting clothing or personal equipment. Wet suits and dry suits are not personal flotation devices.\\n\\n 40.2 When Rule 40.1 Applies\\n\\n Rule 40.1 applies\\n\\n (a) if flag Y was displayed afloat with one sound before or with the warning signal, while racing in that race; or\\n\\n (b) if flag Y was displayed ashore with one sound, at all times while afloat that day.\\n\\n However, rule 40.1 applies when so stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions. \\n\\n 41 OUTSIDE HELP\\n\\n A boat shall not receive help from any outside source, except\\n\\n (a) help for a crew member who is ill, injured or in danger;\\n\\n (b) after a collision, help from the crew of the other vessel to get clear;\\n\\n (c) help in the form of information freely available to all boats;\\n\\n (d) unsolicited information from a disinterested source, which may be another boat in the same race. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n 42 PROPULSION\\n\\n 42.1 Basic Rule\\n\\n Except when permitted in rule 42.3 or 45, a boat shall compete by using only the wind and water to increase, maintain or decrease her speed. Her crew may adjust the trim of sails and hull, and perform other acts of seamanship, but shall not otherwise move their bodies to propel the boat.\\n\\n 42.2 Prohibited Actions\\n\\n Without limiting the application of rule 42.1, these actions are prohibited:\\n\\n (a) pumping: repeated fanning of any sail either by pulling in and releasing the sail or by vertical or athwartship body movement;\\n\\n (b) rocking: repeated rolling of the boat, induced by\\n\\n (1) body movement,\\n\\n (2) repeated adjustment of the sails or centreboard, or\\n\\n (3) steering;\\n\\n (c) ooching: sudden forward body movement, stopped abruptly;\\n\\n (d) sculling: repeated movement of the helm that is either forceful or that propels the boat forward or prevents her from moving astern;\\n\\n (e) repeated tacks or gybes unrelated to changes in the wind or to tactical considerations.\\n\\n 42.3 Exceptions\\n\\n (a) A boat may be rolled to facilitate steering.\\n\\n (b) A boat’s crew may move their bodies to exaggerate the rolling that facilitates steering the boat through a tack or a gybe, provided that, just after the tack or gybe is completed, the boat’s speed is not greater than it would have been in the absence of the tack or gybe.\\n\\n (c) When surfing (rapidly accelerating down the front of a wave), planing or foiling is possible \\n\\n (1) to initiate surfing or planing, each sail may be pulled in only once for each wave or gust of wind, or \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n (2) to initiate foiling, each sail may be pulled in any number of times. \\n\\n (d) When a boat is above a close-hauled course and either stationary or moving slowly, she may scull to turn to a close-hauled course.\\n\\n (e) If a batten is inverted, the boat’s crew may pump the sail until the batten is no longer inverted. This action is not permitted if it clearly propels the boat.\\n\\n (f) A boat may reduce speed by repeatedly moving her helm.\\n\\n (g) Any means of propulsion may be used to help a person or another vessel in danger.\\n\\n (h) To get clear after grounding or colliding with a vessel or object, a boat may use force applied by her crew or the crew of the other vessel and any equipment other than a propulsion engine. However, the use of an engine may be permitted by rule 42.3(i).\\n\\n (i) Sailing instructions may, in stated circumstances, permit propulsion using an engine or any other method, provided the boat does not gain a significant advantage in the race.\\n\\n Note: Interpretations of rule 42 are available at the World Sailing website or by mail upon request.\\n\\n 43 EXONERATION \\n\\n 43.1 (a) When as a consequence of breaking a rule a boat has compelled another boat to break a rule, the other boat is exonerated for her breach.\\n\\n (b) When a boat is sailing within the room or mark-room to which she is entitled and, as a consequence of an incident with a boat required to give her that room or mark-room she breaks a rule of Section A of Part 2, rule 15, 16, or 31, she is exonerated for her breach. \\n\\n (c) A right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark- room to which she is entitled, is exonerated for breaking rule 14 if the contact does not cause damage or injury.\\n\\n 43.2 A boat exonerated for breaking a rule need not take a penalty and shall not be penalized for breaking that rule. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n 44 PENALTIES AT THE TIME OF AN INCIDENT\\n\\n 44.1 Taking a Penalty\\n\\n A boat may take a Two-Turns Penalty when she may have broken one or more rules of Part 2 in an incident while racing. She may take a One-Turn Penalty when she may have broken rule 31. Alternatively, the notice of race or sailing instructions may specify the use of the Scoring Penalty or some other penalty, in which case the specified penalty shall replace the One-Turn and the Two-Turns Penalty. However,\\n\\n (a) when a boat may have broken a rule of Part 2 and rule 31 in the same incident she need not take the penalty for breaking rule 31;\\n\\n (b) if the boat caused injury or serious damage or, despite taking a penalty, gained a significant advantage in the race or series by her breach her penalty shall be to retire.\\n\\n 44.2 One-Turn and Two-Turns Penalties\\n\\n After getting well clear of other boats as soon after the incident as possible, a boat takes a One-Turn or Two-Turns Penalty by promptly making the required number of turns in the same direction, each turn including one tack and one gybe. When a boat takes the penalty at or near the finishing line, her hull shall be completely on the course side of the line before she finishes.\\n\\n 44.3 Scoring Penalty \\n\\n (a) A boat takes a Scoring Penalty by displaying a yellow flag at the first reasonable opportunity after the incident.\\n\\n (b) When a boat has taken a Scoring Penalty, she shall keep the yellow flag displayed until finishing and call the race committee’s attention to it at the finishing line. At that time she shall also inform the race committee of the identity of the other boat involved in the incident. If this is impracticable, she shall do so at the first reasonable opportunity and within the protest time limit. \\n\\n (c) The race score for a boat that takes a Scoring Penalty shall be the score she would have received without that penalty, made worse by the number of places stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions. When the number of places is not stated, the penalty shall be 20% of the score for Did Not Finish, rounded to the nearest whole number (0.5 rounded upward). The scores of\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n other boats shall not be changed; therefore, two boats may receive the same score. However, the penalty shall not cause the boat’s score to be worse than the score for Did Not Finish. \\n\\n 45 HAULING OUT; MAKING FAST; ANCHORING \\n\\n A boat shall be afloat and off moorings at her preparatory signal. Thereafter, she shall not be hauled out or made fast except to bail out, reef sails or make repairs. She may anchor or the crew may stand on the bottom. She shall recover the anchor before continuing in the race unless she is unable to do so.\\n\\n 46 PERSON IN CHARGE\\n\\n A boat shall have on board a person in charge designated by the member or organization that entered the boat. See rule 75.\\n\\n 47 TRASH DISPOSAL \\n\\n Competitors and support persons shall not intentionally put trash in the water. This rule applies at all times while afloat. The penalty for a breach of this rule may be less than disqualification. \\n\\n SECTION B EQUIPMENT-RELATED REQUIREMENTS \\n\\n 48 L IMITATIONS ON EQUIPMENT AND CREW\\n\\n 48.1 A boat shall use only the equipment on board at her preparatory signal.\\n\\n 48.2 No person on board shall intentionally leave, except when ill or injured, or to help a person or vessel in danger, or to swim. A person leaving the boat by accident or to swim shall be back in contact with the boat before the crew resumes sailing the boat to the next mark. \\n\\n 49 CREW POSITION; LIFELINES \\n\\n 49.1 Competitors shall use no device designed to position their bodies outboard, other than hiking straps and stiffeners worn under the thighs.\\n\\n 49.2 When lifelines are required by the class rules or any other rule, competitors shall not position any part of their torsos outside them, except briefly to perform a necessary task. On boats equipped with\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n upper and lower lifelines, a competitor sitting facing outboard with his waist inside the lower lifeline may have the upper part of his body outside the upper lifeline. Unless a class rule or any other rule specifies a maximum deflection, lifelines shall be taut. If the class rules do not specify the material or minimum diameter of lifelines, they shall comply with the corresponding specifications in the World Sailing Offshore Special Regulations.\\n\\n Note: Those regulations are available at the World Sailing website.\\n\\n 50 COMPETITOR CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT \\n\\n 50.1 (a) Competitors shall not wear or carry clothing or equipment for the purpose of increasing their weight.\\n\\n (b) Furthermore, a competitor’s clothing and equipment shall not weigh more than 8 kilograms, excluding a hiking or trapeze harness and clothing (including footwear) worn only below the knee. Class rules or the notice of race may specify a lower weight or a higher weight up to 10 kilograms. Class rules may include footwear and other clothing worn below the knee within that weight. A hiking or trapeze harness shall have positive buoyancy and shall not weigh more than 6 kilograms. Weights shall be determined as required by Appendix H. \\n\\n (c) A trapeze harness worn by a competitor which may be used to support the competitor on a trapeze shall be of the quick release variety complying with ISO 10862 which allows the competitor to detach from the hook or other method of attachment at any time. A class rule may change this rule to permit trapeze harnesses that are not of the quick release variety, but a class rule may not change the requirement that a quick release harness comply with ISO 10862.\\n\\n Note: Rule 50.1(c) does not take effect until 1 January 2023. \\n\\n 50.2 Rules 50.1(b) and 50.1(c) do not apply to boats required to be equipped with lifelines.\\n\\n 51 MOVABLE BALLAST \\n\\n All movable ballast, including sails that are not set, shall be properly stowed. Water, dead weight or ballast shall not be moved for the purpose of changing trim or stability. Floorboards, bulkheads, doors,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n stairs and water tanks shall be left in place and all cabin fixtures kept on board. However, bilge water may be bailed out.\\n\\n 52 MANUAL POWER  A boat’s standing rigging, running rigging, spars and movable hull appendages shall be adjusted and operated only by the power provided by the crew.\\n\\n 53 SKIN FRICTION \\n\\n A boat shall not eject or release a substance, such as a polymer, or have specially textured surfaces that could improve the character of the flow of water inside the boundary layer.\\n\\n 54 FORESTAYS AND HEADSAIL TACKS \\n\\n Forestays and headsail tacks, except those of spinnaker staysails when the boat is not close-hauled, shall be attached approximately on a boat’s centreline.\\n\\n 55 SETTING AND SHEETING SAILS \\n\\n 55.1 Changing Sails\\n\\n When headsails or spinnakers are being changed, a replacing sail may be fully set and trimmed before the replaced sail is lowered. However, only one mainsail and, except when changing, only one spinnaker shall be carried set at a time.\\n\\n 55.2 Spinnaker Poles; Whisker Poles\\n\\n Only one spinnaker pole or whisker pole shall be used at a time except when gybing. When in use, it shall be attached to the foremost mast.\\n\\n 55.3 Sheeting Sails \\n\\n No sail shall be sheeted over or through any device that exerts outward pressure on a sheet or clew of a sail at a point from which, with the boat upright, a vertical line would fall outside the hull or deck, except:\\n\\n (a) a headsail clew may be connected (as defined in The Equipment Rules of Sailing) to a whisker pole, provided that a spinnaker is not set;\\n\\n (b) any sail may be sheeted to or led above a boom that is regularly used for a sail and is permanently attached to the mast from which the head of the sail is set; \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n (c) a headsail may be sheeted to its own boom that requires no adjustment when tacking; and\\n\\n (d) the boom of a sail may be sheeted to a bumkin.\\n\\n 55.4 Headsails and Spinnakers \\n\\n For the purposes of rules 54 and 55 and Appendix G, the definitions of ‘headsail’ and ‘spinnaker’ in The Equipment Rules of Sailing shall be used. \\n\\n 56 FOG SIGNALS AND LIGHTS; TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEMES \\n\\n 56.1 When so equipped, a boat shall sound fog signals and show lights as required by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS) or applicable government rules. \\n\\n 56.2 A boat shall comply with rule 10, Traffic Separation Schemes, of the IRPCAS.\\n\\n Note: Appendix TS, Traffic Separation Schemes, is available at the World Sailing website. The notice of race may change rule 56.2 by stating that Section A, Section B or Section C of Appendix TS applies. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 5\\n\\n#### PROTESTS, REDRESS, HEARINGS, MISCONDUCT AND APPEALS\\n\\n###### The protest form that was included in previous editions of this book has been replaced by two forms, a hearing request form and a hearing decision form. The new forms, in various formats, are available at the World Sailing website at sailing.org/racingrules/documents. They may be downloaded and printed.\\n\\n Note that The Racing Rules of Sailing does not require a particular form to be used.\\n\\n Suggestions for improving these forms are welcome and should be sent to rules@sailing.org. \\n\\n SECTION A PROTESTS; REDRESS; RULE 69 ACTION\\n\\n 60 RIGHT TO PROTEST; RIGHT TO REQUEST REDRESS OR RULE 69 ACTION\\n\\n 60.1 A boat may\\n\\n (a) protest another boat, but not for an alleged breach of a rule of Part 2 or rule 31 unless she was involved in or saw the incident; \\n\\n (b) request redress; or\\n\\n (c) report to the protest committee requesting action under rule 60.3(d) or 69.2(b). \\n\\n 60.2 A race committee may\\n\\n (a) protest a boat, but not as a result of information arising from a request for redress or an invalid protest, or from a report from a person with a conflict of interest other than the representative of the boat herself;\\n\\n (b) request redress for a boat; or\\n\\n (c) report to the protest committee requesting action under rule 60.3(d) or 69.2(b). \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n 60.3 A protest committee may\\n\\n (a) protest a boat, but not as a result of information arising from a request for redress or an invalid protest, or from a report from a person with a conflict of interest other than the representative of the boat herself. However, it may protest a boat \\n\\n (1) if it learns of an incident involving her that may have resulted in injury or serious damage, or\\n\\n (2) if during the hearing of a valid protest it learns that the boat, although not a party to the hearing, was involved in the incident and may have broken a rule;\\n\\n (b) call a hearing to consider redress; \\n\\n (c) act under rule 69.2(b); or\\n\\n (d) call a hearing to consider whether a support person has broken a rule, based on its own observation or information received from any source, including evidence taken during a hearing. \\n\\n 60.4 A technical committee may\\n\\n (a) protest a boat, but not as a result of information arising from a request for redress or an invalid protest, or from a report from a person with a conflict of interest other than the representative of the boat herself. However, it shall protest a boat if it decides that a boat or personal equipment does not comply with the class rules or with rule 50; \\n\\n (b) request redress for a boat; or\\n\\n (c) report to the protest committee requesting action under rule 60.3(d) or 69.2(b). \\n\\n 60.5 However, neither a boat nor a committee may protest for an alleged breach of rule 69 or a Regulation referred to in rule 6, unless permitted by the Regulation concerned. \\n\\n 61 PROTEST REQUIREMENTS\\n\\n 61.1 Informing the Protestee\\n\\n (a) The protesting boat shall inform the other boat at the first reasonable opportunity. When her protest will concern an incident in the racing area, she shall hail ‘Protest’ and conspicuously display a red flag at the first reasonable\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n opportunity for each. She shall display the flag until she is no longer racing. However,\\n\\n (1) if the other boat is beyond hailing distance, the protesting boat need not hail but she shall inform the other boat at the first reasonable opportunity;\\n\\n (2) if the hull length of the protesting boat is less than  6 metres, she need not display a red flag;\\n\\n (3) if the incident was an error by the other boat in sailing the course, she need not hail or display a red flag but she shall inform the other boat either before or at the first reasonable opportunity after the other boat finishes;\\n\\n (4) if at the time of the incident it is obvious to the protesting boat that a member of either crew is in danger, or that injury or serious damage resulted, the requirements of this rule do not apply to her, but she shall attempt to inform the other boat within the time limit of rule 61.3. \\n\\n (b) If the race committee, technical committee or protest committee intends to protest a boat concerning an incident the committee observed in the racing area, it shall inform her after the race within the time limit of rule 61.3. In other cases the committee shall inform the boat of its intention to protest as soon as reasonably possible. A notice posted on the official notice board within the appropriate time limit satisfies this requirement. \\n\\n (c) If the protest committee decides to protest a boat under rule 60.3(a)(2), it shall inform her as soon as reasonably possible, close the current hearing, proceed as required by rules 61.2 and 63, and hear the original and the new protests together.\\n\\n 61.2 Protest Contents\\n\\n A protest shall be in writing and identify\\n\\n (a) the protestor and protestee;\\n\\n (b) the incident;\\n\\n (c) where and when the incident occurred;\\n\\n (d) any rule the protestor believes was broken; and\\n\\n (e) the name of the protestor’s representative.\\n\\n However, if requirement (b) is met, requirement (a) may be met at any time before the hearing, and requirements (d) and (e) may be met\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n before or during the hearing. Requirement (c) may also be met before or during the hearing, provided the protestee is allowed reasonable time to prepare for the hearing. \\n\\n 61.3 Protest Time Limit\\n\\n A protest by a boat, or by the race committee, technical committee or protest committee about an incident observed in the racing area, shall be delivered to the race office within the protest time limit stated in the sailing instructions. If none is stated, the time limit is two hours after the last boat in the race finishes. Other protests shall be delivered to the race office no later than two hours after the protestor receives the relevant information. The protest committee shall extend the time if there is good reason to do so. \\n\\n 62 REDRESS\\n\\n 62.1 A request for redress or a protest committee’s decision to consider redress shall be based on a claim or possibility that a boat’s score or place in a race or series has been or may be, through no fault of her own, made significantly worse by \\n\\n (a) an improper action or omission of the race committee, protest committee, organizing authority or technical committee for the event, but not by a protest committee decision when the boat was a party to the hearing; \\n\\n (b) injury or physical damage because of the action of a boat that was breaking a rule of Part 2 and took an appropriate penalty or was penalized, or of a vessel not racing that was required to keep clear or is determined to be at fault under the IRPCAS or a government right-of-way rule; \\n\\n (c) giving help (except to herself or her crew) in compliance with rule 1.1; or\\n\\n (d) an action of another boat, or a crew member or support person of that boat, that resulted in a penalty under rule 2 or a penalty or warning under rule 69. \\n\\n 62.2 A request shall be in writing and identify the reason for making it. If the request is based on an incident in the racing area, it shall be delivered to the race office within the protest time limit or two hours after the incident, whichever is later. Other requests shall be delivered as soon as reasonably possible after learning of the reasons for making\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n the request. The protest committee shall extend the time if there is good reason to do so. No red flag is required.\\n\\n (a) However, on the last scheduled day of racing a request for redress based on a protest committee decision shall be delivered no later than 30 minutes after the decision was posted. \\n\\n SECTION B HEARINGS AND DECISIONS\\n\\n 63 HEARINGS\\n\\n 63.1 Requirement for a Hearing\\n\\n A boat or competitor shall not be penalized without a protest hearing, except as provided in rules 30.2, 30.3, 30.4, 64.4(d), 64.5(b), 69, 78.2, A5.1 and P2. A decision on redress shall not be made without a hearing. The protest committee shall hear all protests and requests for redress that have been delivered to the race office unless it allows a protest or request to be withdrawn.\\n\\n 63.2 Time and Place of the Hearing; Time for Parties to Prepare\\n\\n All parties to the hearing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing, the protest or redress information or the allegations shall be made available to them, and they shall be allowed reasonable time to prepare for the hearing. When two or more hearings arise from the same incident, or from very closely connected incidents, they may be heard together in one hearing. However, a hearing conducted under rule 69 shall not be combined with any other type of hearing. \\n\\n 63.3 Right to Be Present\\n\\n (a) A representative of each party to the hearing has the right to be present throughout the hearing of all the evidence. When a protest claims a breach of a rule of Part 2, 3 or 4, the representatives of boats shall have been on board at the time of the incident, unless there is good reason for the protest committee to rule otherwise. Any witness, other than a member of the protest committee, shall be excluded except when giving evidence. \\n\\n (b) If a party to a hearing does not come to the hearing, the protest committee may nevertheless proceed with the hearing. If the\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n party was unavoidably absent, the committee may reopen the hearing.\\n\\n 63.4 Conflict of Interest\\n\\n (a) A protest committee member shall declare any possible conflict of interest as soon as he is aware of it. A party to the hearing who believes a member of the protest committee has a conflict of interest shall object as soon as possible. A conflict of interest declared by a protest committee member shall be included in the written information provided under rule 65.2.\\n\\n (b) A member of a protest committee with a conflict of interest shall not be a member of the committee for the hearing, unless\\n\\n (1) all parties consent, or\\n\\n (2) the protest committee decides that the conflict of interest is not significant. \\n\\n (c) When deciding whether a conflict of interest is significant, the protest committee shall consider the views of the parties, the level of the conflict, the level of the event, the importance to each party, and the overall perception of fairness.\\n\\n (d) However, for World Sailing major events, or for other events as prescribed by the national authority of the venue, rule 63.4(b) does not apply and a person who has a conflict of interest shall not be a member of the protest committee. \\n\\n 63.5 Validity of the Protest or Request for Redress \\n\\n At the beginning of the hearing the protest committee shall take any evidence it considers necessary to decide whether all requirements for the protest or request for redress have been met. If they have been met, the protest or request is valid and the hearing shall be continued. If not, the committee shall declare the protest or request invalid and close the hearing. If the protest has been made under rule 60.3(a)(1), the committee shall also determine whether or not injury or serious damage resulted from the incident in question. If not, the hearing shall be closed. \\n\\n 63.6 Taking Evidence and Finding Facts\\n\\n (a) The protest committee shall take the evidence, including hearsay evidence, of the parties present at the hearing and of their witnesses and other evidence it considers necessary. However,\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n the committee may exclude evidence which it considers to be irrelevant or unduly repetitive. \\n\\n (b) A member of the protest committee who saw the incident shall, while the parties are present, state that fact and may give evidence.\\n\\n (c) A party present at the hearing may question any person who gives evidence.\\n\\n (d) The committee shall then give the weight it considers appropriate to the evidence presented, find the facts and base its decision on them. \\n\\n 63.7 Conflict Between Rules \\n\\n If there is a conflict between two or more rules that must be resolved before the protest committee makes a decision, the committee shall apply the rule that it believes will provide the fairest result for all boats affected. Rule 63.7 applies only if the conflict is between rules in the notice of race, the sailing instructions, or any of the other documents that govern the event under item (g) of the definition Rule. \\n\\n 63.8 Hearings Involving Parties in Different Events \\n\\n A hearing involving parties in different events conducted by different organizing authorities shall be heard by a protest committee acceptable to those authorities. \\n\\n 63.9 Hearings under Rule 60.3(d) — Support Persons\\n\\n If the protest committee decides to call a hearing under rule 60.3(d), it shall promptly follow the procedures in rules 63.2, 63.3, 63.4 and 63.6, except that the information given to the parties shall be details of the alleged breach and a person may be appointed by the protest committee to present the allegation. \\n\\n 64 DECISIONS\\n\\n 64.1 Standard of Proof, Majority Decisions and Reclassifying Requests\\n\\n (a) A protest committee shall make its decision based on a balance of probabilities, unless provided for otherwise in the rule alleged to have been broken.\\n\\n (b) Decisions of the protest committee shall be by simple majority vote of all members. When there is equal division of votes cast, the chairman may cast an additional vote.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n (c) The protest committee shall proceed with each case, as a protest, request for redress or other type of request, based on the information in the written request or allegation and testimony during the hearing. This permits the type of case to be changed if appropriate. \\n\\n 64.2 Penalties\\n\\n When the protest committee decides that a boat that is a party to a protest hearing has broken a rule and is not exonerated, it shall disqualify her unless some other penalty applies. A penalty shall be imposed whether or not the applicable rule was mentioned in the protest. If a boat has broken a rule when not racing, her penalty shall apply to the race sailed nearest in time to that of the incident. However,\\n (a) if a boat has taken an applicable penalty, she shall not be further penalized under this rule unless the penalty for a rule she broke is a disqualification that is not excludable from her series score; \\n\\n (b) if the race is restarted or resailed, rule 36 applies.\\n\\n 64.3 Decisions on Redress\\n\\n When the protest committee decides that a boat is entitled to redress under rule 62, it shall make as fair an arrangement as possible for all boats affected, whether or not they asked for redress. This may be to adjust the scoring (see rule A9 for some examples) or finishing times of boats, to abandon the race, to let the results stand or to make some\\\\ other arrangement. When in doubt about the facts or probable results of any arrangement for the race or series, especially before abandoning the race, the protest committee shall take evidence from appropriate sources.\\n\\n 64.4 Decisions on Protests Concerning Class Rules\\n\\n (a) When the protest committee finds that deviations in excess of tolerances specified in the class rules were caused by damage or normal wear and do not improve the performance of the boat, it shall not penalize her. However, the boat shall not race again until the deviations have been corrected, except when the protest committee decides there is or has been no reasonable opportunity to do so.\\n\\n (b) When the protest committee is in doubt about the meaning of a class rule, it shall refer its questions, together with the relevant facts, to an authority responsible for interpreting the rule. In\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n making its decision, the committee shall be bound by the reply of the authority.\\n\\n (c) When a boat is penalized under a class rule and the protest committee decides that the boat also broke the same rule in earlier races in the same event, the penalty may be imposed for all such races. No further protest is necessary. \\n\\n (d) When a boat penalized under a class rule states in writing that she intends to appeal, she may compete in subsequent races without changes to the boat. However, if she fails to appeal or the appeal is decided against her, she shall be disqualified without a further hearing from all subsequent races in which she competed. \\n\\n (e) Measurement costs arising from a protest involving a class rule shall be paid by the unsuccessful party unless the protest committee decides otherwise.\\n\\n 64.5 Decisions Concerning Support Persons\\n\\n (a) When the protest committee decides that a support person who is a party to a hearing under rule 60.3(d) or 69 has broken a rule, it may\\n\\n (1) issue a warning,\\n\\n (2) exclude the person from the event or venue or remove any privileges or benefits, or\\n\\n (3) take other action within its jurisdiction as provided by the rules.\\n\\n (b) The protest committee may also penalize a boat that is a party to a hearing under rule 60.3(d) or 69 for the breach of a rule by a support person by changing the boat’s score in a single race, up to and including disqualification, when the protest committee decides that\\n\\n (1) the boat may have gained a competitive advantage as the result of the breach by the support person, or\\n\\n (2) the support person committed a further breach after the protest committee warned the boat in writing, following a previous hearing, that a penalty may be imposed. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n 64.6 Discretionary Penalties\\n\\n When a boat reports within the protest time limit that she has broken a rule subject to a discretionary penalty, the protest committee shall decide the appropriate penalty after taking evidence from the boat and any witnesses it decides are appropriate. \\n\\n 65 INFORMING THE PARTIES AND OTHERS\\n\\n 65.1 After making its decision, the protest committee shall promptly inform the parties to the hearing of the facts found, the applicable rules, the decision, the reasons for it, and any penalties imposed or redress given.\\n\\n 65.2 A party to the hearing is entitled to receive the above information in writing, provided she asks for it in writing from the protest committee no later than seven days after being informed of the decision. The committee shall then promptly provide the information, including, when relevant, a diagram of the incident prepared or endorsed by the committee.\\n\\n 65.3 Unless there is good reason not to do so, after any hearing, including a hearing under rule 69, the protest committee may publish the information set out in rule 65.1. The protest committee may direct that the information is to be confidential to the parties.\\n\\n 65.4 When the protest committee penalizes a boat under a class rule, it shall send the above information to the relevant class rule authorities. \\n\\n 66 REOPENING A HEARING\\n\\n 66.1 The protest committee may reopen a hearing when it decides that it may have made a significant error, or when significant new evidence becomes available within a reasonable time. It shall reopen a hearing when required by the national authority under rule 71.2 or R5. \\n\\n 66.2 A party to the hearing may request a reopening in writing no later than 24 hours after being informed of the decision.\\n\\n (a) However, on the last scheduled day of racing the request shall be delivered\\n\\n (1) within the protest time limit if the requesting party was informed of the decision on the previous day;\\n\\n (2) no later than 30 minutes after the party was informed of the decision on that day.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n 66.3 The protest committee shall consider all requests to reopen. When a request to reopen is being considered or the hearing is reopened, \\n\\n (a) when based only on new evidence, a majority of the members of the protest committee shall, if practicable, be members of the original committee;\\n\\n (b) when based on a significant error, the protest committee shall, if practicable, have at least one new member.\\n\\n 67 DAMAGES\\n\\n The question of damages arising from a breach of any rule shall be governed by the prescriptions, if any, of the national authority.\\n\\n Note: There is no rule 68.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n SECTION C MISCONDUCT\\n\\n 69 MISCONDUCT\\n\\n 69.1 Obligation not to Commit Misconduct; Resolution\\n\\n (a) A competitor, boat owner or support person shall not commit an act of misconduct. \\n\\n (b) Misconduct is: \\n\\n (1) conduct that is a breach of good manners, a breach of good sportsmanship, or unethical behaviour; or\\n\\n (2) conduct that may bring, or has brought, the sport into disrepute. \\n\\n (c) An allegation of a breach of rule 69.1(a) shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of rule 69. It shall not be grounds for a protest and rule 63.1 does not apply. \\n\\n 69.2 Action by a Protest Committee\\n\\n (a) A protest committee acting under this rule shall have at least three members. \\n\\n (b) When a protest committee, from its own observation or from information received from any source, including evidence taken during a hearing, believes a person may have broken rule 69.1(a), it shall decide whether or not to call a hearing. \\n\\n (c) When the protest committee needs more information to make the decision to call a hearing, it shall consider appointing a person or persons to conduct an investigation. These investigators shall not be members of the protest committee that will decide the matter. \\n\\n (d) When an investigator is appointed, all relevant information he gathers, favourable or unfavourable, shall be disclosed to the protest committee, and if the protest committee decides to call a hearing, to the parties. \\n\\n (e) If the protest committee decides to call a hearing, it shall promptly inform the person in writing of the alleged breach and of the time and place of the hearing and follow the procedures in rules 63.2, 63.3(a), 63.4, 63.6, 65.1, 65.2, 65.3 and 66, except that: \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n (1) unless a person has been appointed by World Sailing, a person may be appointed by the protest committee to present the allegation. \\n\\n (2) a person against whom an allegation has been made under this rule shall be entitled to have an advisor and a representative with him who may act on his behalf. \\n\\n (f) If the person \\n\\n (1) provides good reason why he is unable to come to the hearing at the scheduled time, the protest committee shall reschedule it; or \\n\\n (2) does not provide good reason and does not come to the hearing, the protest committee may conduct it without the person present. \\n\\n (g) The standard of proof to be applied is the test of the comfortable satisfaction of the protest committee, bearing in mind the seriousness of the alleged misconduct. However, if the standard of proof in this rule conflicts with the laws of a country, the national authority may, with the approval of World Sailing, change it with a prescription to this rule. \\n\\n (h) When the protest committee decides that a competitor or boat owner has broken rule 69.1(a), it may take one or more of the following actions\\n\\n (1) issue a warning; \\n\\n (2) change their boat’s score in one or more races, including disqualification(s) that may or may not be excluded from her series score; \\n\\n (3) exclude the person from the event or venue or remove any privileges or benefits; and\\n\\n (4) take any other action within its jurisdiction as provided by the rules. \\n\\n (i) When the protest committee decides that a support person has broken rule 69.1(a), rule 64.5 applies.\\n\\n (j) If the protest committee\\n\\n (1) imposes a penalty greater than one DNE; \\n\\n (2) excludes the person from the event or venue; or\\n\\n (3) in any other case if it considers it appropriate, \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n it shall report its findings, including the facts found, its conclusions and decision to the national authority of the person or, for specific international events listed in the World Sailing Regulations, to World Sailing. If the protest committee has acted under rule 69.2(f)(2), the report shall also include that fact and the reasons for it. \\n\\n (k) If the protest committee decides not to conduct the hearing without the person present, or if the protest committee has left the event and a report alleging a breach of rule 69.1(a) is received, the race committee or organizing authority may appoint the same or a new protest committee to proceed under this rule. If it is impractical for the protest committee to conduct a hearing, it shall collect all available information and, if the allegation seems justified, make a report to the national authority of the person or, for specific international events listed in the World Sailing Regulations, to World Sailing. \\n\\n 69.3 Action by a National Authority and World Sailing\\n\\n The disciplinary powers, procedures and responsibilities of national authorities and World Sailing that apply are specified in the World Sailing Disciplinary Code. National authorities and World Sailing may impose further penalties, including suspension of eligibility, under that code. \\n\\n SECTION D APPEALS\\n\\n 70 APPEALS AND REQUESTS TO A NATIONAL AUTHORITY\\n\\n 70.1 (a) Provided that the right of appeal has not been denied under rule 70.5, a party to a hearing may appeal a protest committee’s decision or its procedures, but not the facts found.\\n\\n (b) A boat may appeal when she is denied a hearing required by rule 63.1.\\n\\n 70.2 A protest committee may request confirmation or correction of its decision.\\n\\n 70.3 An appeal under rule 70.1 or a request by a protest committee under rule 70.2 shall be sent to the national authority with which the\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n organizing authority is associated under rule 89.1. However, if boats will pass through the waters of more than one national authority while racing, an appeal or request shall be sent to the national authority where the finishing line is located, unless the sailing instructions identify another national authority. \\n\\n 70.4 A club or other organization affiliated to a national authority may request an interpretation of the rules, provided that no protest or request for redress that may be appealed is involved. The interpretation shall not be used for changing a previous protest committee decision.\\n\\n 70.5 There shall be no appeal from the decisions of an international jury constituted in compliance with Appendix N. Furthermore, if the notice of race or the sailing instructions so state, the right of appeal may be denied provided that\\n\\n (a) it is essential to determine promptly the result of a race that will qualify a boat to compete in a later stage of an event or a subsequent event (a national authority may prescribe that its approval is required for such a procedure);\\n\\n (b) a national authority so approves for a particular event open only to boats entered by an organization affiliated to that national authority, a member of an organization affiliated to that national authority, or a personal member of that national authority; or \\n\\n (c) a national authority after consultation with World Sailing so approves for a particular event, provided the protest committee is constituted as required by Appendix N, except that only two members of the protest committee need be International Judges.\\n\\n 70.6 Appeals and requests shall conform to Appendix R.\\n\\n 71 NATIONAL AUTHORITY DECISIONS\\n\\n 71.1 A person who has a conflict of interest or was a member of the protest committee shall not take any part in the discussion or decision on an appeal or a request for confirmation or correction. \\n\\n 71.2 The national authority may uphold, change or reverse a protest committee’s decision including a decision on validity or a decision under rule 69. Alternatively, the national authority may order that a hearing be reopened, or that a new hearing be held by the same or a\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n######,,,\\n\\n different protest committee. When the national authority decides that there shall be a new hearing, it may appoint the protest committee.\\n\\n 71.3 When from the facts found by the protest committee the national authority decides that a boat that was a party to a protest hearing broke a rule and is not exonerated, it shall penalize her, whether or not that boat or that rule was mentioned in the protest committee’s decision. \\n\\n 71.4 The decision of the national authority shall be final. The national authority shall send its decision in writing to all parties to the hearing and the protest committee, who shall be bound by the decision.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 6\\n\\n#### ENTRY AND QUALIFICATION\\n\\n###### 75 ENTERING AN EVENT\\n\\n To enter an event, a boat shall comply with the requirements of the organizing authority of the event. She shall be entered by \\n\\n (a) a member of a club or other organization affiliated to a World Sailing member national authority,\\n\\n (b) such a club or organization, or\\n\\n (c) a member of a World Sailing member national authority.\\n\\n 76 EXCLUSION OF BOATS OR COMPETITORS\\n\\n 76.1 The organizing authority or the race committee may reject or cancel the entry of a boat or exclude a competitor, subject to rule 76.3, provided it does so before the start of the first race and states the reason for doing so. On request the boat shall promptly be given the reason in writing. The boat may request redress if she considers that the rejection or exclusion is improper.\\n\\n 76.2 The organizing authority or the race committee shall not reject or cancel the entry of a boat or exclude a competitor because of advertising, provided the boat or competitor complies with the World Sailing Advertising Code. \\n\\n 76.3 At world and continental championships no entry within stated quotas shall be rejected or cancelled without first obtaining the approval of the relevant World Sailing Class Association (or the Offshore Racing Council) or World Sailing.\\n\\n 77 IDENTIFICATION ON SAILS\\n\\n A boat shall comply with the requirements of Appendix G governing class insignia, national letters and numbers on sails.\\n\\n 78 COMPLIANCE WITH CLASS RULES; CERTIFICATES\\n\\n 78.1 While a boat is racing, her owner and any other person in charge shall ensure that the boat is maintained to comply with her class rules and that her measurement or rating certificate, if any, remains valid. In\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Q\\n\\n addition, the boat shall also comply at other times specified in the class rules, the notice of race or the sailing instructions. \\n\\n 78.2 When a rule requires a valid certificate to be produced or its existence verified before a boat races, and this cannot be done, the boat may race provided that the race committee receives a statement signed by the person in charge that a valid certificate exists. The boat shall produce the certificate or arrange for its existence to be verified by the race committee before the start of the last day of the event, or of the first series, whichever is earlier. The penalty for breaking this rule is disqualification without a hearing from all races of the event. \\n\\n 79 CATEGORIZATION\\n\\n If the notice of race or class rules state that some or all competitors must satisfy categorization requirements, the categorization shall be carried out as described in the World Sailing Sailor Categorization Code. \\n\\n 80 RESCHEDULED EVENT\\n\\n When an event is rescheduled to dates different from the dates stated in the notice of race, all boats entered shall be notified. The race committee may accept new entries that meet all the entry requirements except the original deadline for entries.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 7\\n\\n#### RACE ORGANIZATION\\n\\n###### 85 CHANGES TO RULES \\n\\n 85.1 A change to a rule shall refer specifically to the rule and state the change.

The authorization shall be stated in a letter of approval to the organizing authority and in the notice of race or sailing instructions, and the letter shall be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n 86.3 If a national authority so prescribes, the restrictions in rule 86.1 do not apply if rules are changed to develop or test proposed rules. The national authority may prescribe that its approval is required for such changes.\\n\\n 87 CHANGES TO CLASS RULES\\n\\n The notice of race may change a class rule only when the class rules permit the change, or when written permission of the class association for the change is posted on the official notice board. \\n\\n 88 NATIONAL PRESCRIPTIONS\\n\\n 88.1 Prescriptions that Apply\\n\\n The prescriptions that apply to an event are the prescriptions of the national authority with which the organizing authority is associated under rule 89.1. However, if boats will pass through the waters of more than one national authority while racing, the notice of race shall identify the prescriptions that will apply and when they will apply. \\n\\n 88.2 Changes to Prescriptions\\n\\n The notice of race or sailing instructions may change a prescription. However, a national authority may restrict changes to its prescriptions with a prescription to this rule, provided World Sailing approves its application to do so. The restricted prescriptions shall not be changed. \\n\\n 89 ORGANIZING AUTHORITY; NOTICE OF RACE; APPOINTMENT OF RACE OFFICIALS\\n\\n 89.1 Organizing Authority\\n\\n Races shall be organized by an organizing authority, which shall be\\n\\n (a) World Sailing;\\n\\n (b) a member national authority of World Sailing;\\n\\n (c) an affiliated club;\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (d) an affiliated organization other than a club and, if so prescribed by the national authority, with the approval of the national authority or in conjunction with an affiliated club;\\n\\n (e) an unaffiliated class association, either with the approval of the national authority or in conjunction with an affiliated club;\\n\\n (f) two or more of the above organizations;\\n\\n (g) an unaffiliated body in conjunction with an affiliated club where the body is owned and controlled by the club. The national authority of the club may prescribe that its approval is required for such an event; or\\n\\n (h) if approved by World Sailing and the national authority of the club, an unaffiliated body in conjunction with an affiliated club where the body is not owned and controlled by the club.\\n\\n In rule 89.1, an organization is affiliated if it is affiliated to the national authority of the venue; otherwise the organization is unaffiliated. However, if boats will pass through the waters of more than one national authority while racing, an organization is affiliated if it is affiliated to the national authority of one of the ports of call.\\n\\n 89.2 Notice of Race; Appointment of Race Officials\\n\\n (a) The organizing authority shall publish a notice of race that conforms to rule J1. \\n\\n (b) The notice of race may be changed provided adequate notice is\\n given.\\n\\n (c) The organizing authority shall appoint a race committee and, when appropriate, appoint a protest committee, a technical committee and umpires.

Oral changes may be given only on the water, and only if the procedure is stated in the sailing instructions.\\n\\n 90.3 Scoring\\n\\n (a) The race committee shall score a race or series as provided in Appendix A unless the notice of race or sailing instructions specify some other system. A race shall be scored if it is not abandoned and if one boat starts, sails the course and finishes within the race time limit, if any, even if she retires after finishing or is disqualified.\\n\\n (b) When a scoring system provides for excluding one or more race scores, any score that is a Disqualification Not Excludable (DNE) shall be included in a boat’s series score. \\n\\n (c) When the race committee determines from its own records or observations that it has scored a boat incorrectly, it shall correct the error and make the corrected scores available to competitors.\\n\\n (d) The race committee shall implement scoring changes directed by the protest committee or national authority as a result of decisions made in accordance with the rules.\\n\\n (e) When so stated in the notice of race, notwithstanding the provisions of rules 90.3(a), (b), (c) and (d), there shall be no changes to race or series scores resulting from action, including the correction of errors, initiated more than 24 hours after\\n\\n (1) the protest time limit for the last race of the series (including a single-race series); \\n\\n (2) being informed of a protest committee decision after the last race of the series (including a single-race series); or \\n\\n (3) the results are published. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### However, in exception, changes to scores shall be made resulting from a decision under rules 6, 69 or 70.

However, the notice of race or sailing instructions may make a different arrangement by providing, for example, that no score will be excluded, that two or more scores will be excluded, or that a specified number of scores will be excluded if a specified number of races are completed. A race is completed if scored; see rule 90.3(a). If a boat has two or more equal worst scores, the score(s) for the race(s) sailed earliest in the series shall be excluded. The boat with the lowest series score wins and others shall be ranked accordingly. \\n\\n A2.2 If a boat has entered any race in a series, she shall be scored for the whole series. \\n\\n A3 STARTING TIMES AND FINISHING PLACES \\n\\n The time of a boat’s starting signal shall be her starting time, and the order in which boats finish a race shall determine their finishing places. However, when a handicap or rating system is used a boat’s corrected time shall determine her finishing place.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n A4 SCORING SYSTEM\\n\\n This Low Point System will apply unless the notice of race or sailing instructions specify another system; see rule 90.3(a). \\n\\n Each boat starting and finishing and not thereafter retiring, being penalized or given redress shall be scored points as follows:\\n\\n Finishing place Points\\n\\n First 1\\n\\n Second 2\\n\\n Third 3\\n\\n Fourth 4\\n\\n Fifth 5\\n\\n Sixth 6\\n\\n Seventh 7\\n\\n Each place thereafter Add 1 point\\n\\n A5 SCORES DETERMINED BY THE RACE COMMITTEE \\n\\n A5.1 A boat that did not start, sail the course or finish, or comply with rule 30.2, 30.3, 30.4 or 78.2, or that retires or takes a penalty under rule 44.3(a), shall be scored accordingly by the race committee without a hearing. Only the protest committee may take other scoring actions that worsen a boat’s score. \\n\\n A5.2 A boat that did not start, did not sail the course, did not finish, retired or was disqualified shall be scored points for the finishing place one more than the number of boats entered in the series. A boat that is penalized under rule 30.2 or that takes a penalty under rule 44.3(a) shall be scored points as provided in rule 44.3(c).\\n\\n A5.3 If the notice of race or sailing instructions state that rule A5.3 will apply, rule A5.2 is changed so that a boat that came to the starting area but did not start, did not sail the course, did not finish, retired or was disqualified shall be scored points for the finishing place one more than the number of boats that came to the starting area, and a boat that did not come to the starting area shall be scored points for the finishing place one more than the number of boats entered in the series. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n A6 CHANGES IN PLACES AND SCORES OF OTHER BOATS\\n\\n A6.1 If a boat is disqualified from a race or retires after finishing, each boat with a worse finishing place shall be moved up one place.\\n\\n A6.2 If the protest committee decides to give redress by adjusting a boat’s score, the scores of other boats shall not be changed unless the protest committee decides otherwise.\\n\\n A7 RACE TIES If boats are tied at the finishing line or if a handicap or rating system is used and boats have equal corrected times, the points for the place for which the boats have tied and for the place(s) immediately below shall be added together and divided equally. Boats tied for a race prize shall share it or be given equal prizes.\\n\\n A8 SERIES TIES\\n\\n A8.1 If there is a series-score tie between two or more boats, each boat’s race scores shall be listed in order of best to worst, and at the first point(s) where there is a difference the tie shall be broken in favour of the boat(s) with the best score(s). No excluded scores shall be used.\\n\\n A8.2 If a tie remains between two or more boats, they shall be ranked in order of their scores in the last race. Any remaining ties shall be broken by using the tied boats’ scores in the next-to-last race and so on until all ties are broken. These scores shall be used even if some of them are excluded scores.\\n\\n A9 GUIDANCE ON REDRESS\\n\\n If the protest committee decides to give redress by adjusting a boat’s score for a race, it is advised to consider scoring her\\n\\n (a) points equal to the average, to the nearest tenth of a point (0.05 to be rounded upward), of her points in all the races in the series except the race in question;\\n\\n (b) points equal to the average, to the nearest tenth of a point (0.05 to be rounded upward), of her points in all the races before the race in question; or\\n\\n (c) points based on the position of the boat in the race at the time of the incident that justified redress.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n A10 SCORING ABBREVIATIONS\\n\\n These scoring abbreviations shall be used for recording the circumstances described:\\n\\n DNC Did not start; did not come to the starting area\\n\\n DNS Did not start (other than DNC and OCS)\\n\\n OCS Did not start; on the course side of the starting line at her starting signal and failed to start, or broke rule 30.1 \\n\\n ZFP 20% penalty under rule 30.2\\n\\n UFD Disqualification under rule 30.3 \\n\\n BFD Disqualification under rule 30.4\\n\\n SCP Scoring Penalty applied \\n\\n NSC Did not sail the course\\n\\n DNF Did not finish\\n\\n RET Retired\\n\\n DSQ Disqualification\\n\\n DNE Disqualification that is not excludable \\n\\n RDG Redress given\\n\\n DPI Discretionary penalty imposed\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX B \\n#### WINDSURFING FLEET RACING RULES \\n\\n###### Windsurfing fleet races (including marathon races) shall be sailed under The Racing Rules of Sailing as changed by this appendix. The term ‘boat’ elsewhere in the racing rules means ‘board’ or ‘boat’ as appropriate. A marathon race is a race intended to last more than one hour. \\n\\n Note: Rules for Slalom, Expression (including Wave and Freestyle) and Speed disciplines are not included in this appendix. These are available at the World Sailing website.\\n\\n CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS\\n\\n The definitions Mark-Room, and Tack, Starboard or Port are changed to:\\n\\n Mark-Room Mark-Room for a board is room to sail her proper course to round or pass the mark. However, mark-room for a board does not include room to tack unless she is overlapped inside and to windward of the board required to give mark-room and she would be fetching the mark after her tack.\\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port  A board is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to the competitor’s hand that would be nearer the mast if the competitor were in normal sailing position with both hands on the wishbone and arms not crossed. A board is on starboard tack when the competitor’s right hand would be nearer the mast and is on port tack when the competitor’s left hand would be nearer the mast. \\n\\n The definition Zone is deleted. \\n\\n Add the following definitions:\\n\\n Capsized  A board is capsized when she is not under control because her sail or the competitor is in the water. \\n\\n Rounding or Passing  A board is rounding or passing a mark from the time her proper course is to begin to manoeuvre to round or pass it, until the mark has been rounded or passed. \\n\\n B1 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 1\\n\\n [No changes.]\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n B2 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 2\\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n Rule 13 is changed to:\\n\\n After a board passes head to wind, she shall keep clear of other boards until her sail has filled. During that time rules 10, 11 and 12 do not apply. If two boards are subject to this rule at the same time, the one on the other’s port side or the one astern shall keep clear. \\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK BEFORE A REACHING START \\n\\n Rule 17 is changed to:\\n\\n When, at the warning signal, the course to the first mark is approximately ninety degrees from the true wind, a board overlapped to leeward of another board on the same tack during the last 30 seconds before her starting signal shall not sail above the shortest course to the first mark while they remain overlapped if as a result the other board would need to take action to avoid contact, unless in doing so she promptly sails astern of the other board. \\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n Rule 18 is changed as follows:\\n\\n The first sentence of rule 18.1 is changed to: \\n\\n Rule 18 applies between boards when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is rounding or passing it. \\n\\n Rule 18.2(b) is changed to: \\n\\n (b) If boards are overlapped when the first of them is rounding or passing the mark, the outside board at that moment shall thereafter give the inside board mark-room.

Furthermore, a boat that displays an incorrect flag or does not display the correct flag shall be warned orally and given an opportunity to correct the error before being penalized.\\n\\n C8.3 When the umpires decide that a boat has\\n\\n (a) gained an advantage by breaking a rule after allowing for a penalty,\\n\\n (b) deliberately broken a rule, or\\n\\n (c) committed a breach of sportsmanship,\\n\\n she shall be penalized under rule C5.2, C5.3 or C5.4.\\n\\n C8.4 If the umpires or protest committee members decide that a boat may have broken a rule other than those listed in rules C6.1(a) and C6.2, they shall so inform the protest committee for its action under rule 60.3 and rule C6.6 when appropriate.\\n\\n C8.5 When, after one boat has started, the umpires are satisfied that the other boat will not start, they may signal under rule C5.4 that the boat that did not start is disqualified and the match is terminated.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n C8.6 When the match umpires, together with at least one other umpire, decide that a boat has broken rule 14 and damage resulted, they may impose a points-penalty without a hearing. The competitor shall be informed of the penalty as soon as practicable and, at the time of being so informed, may request a hearing. The protest committee shall then proceed under rule C6.6. Any penalty decided by the protest committee may be more than the penalty imposed by the umpires. When the umpires decide that a penalty greater than one point is appropriate, they shall act under rule C8.4.\\n\\n C9 REQUESTS FOR REDRESS OR REOPENING; APPEALS; OTHER PROCEEDINGS\\n\\n C9.1 There shall be no request for redress or an appeal from a decision made under rule C5, C6, C7 or C8. In rule 66 the third sentence is changed to: ‘A party to the hearing may not ask for a reopening.’\\n\\n C9.2 A competitor may not base a request for redress on a claim that an action by an official boat was improper. The protest committee may decide to consider giving redress in such circumstances but only if it believes that an official boat, including an umpire boat, may have seriously interfered with a competing boat.\\n\\n C9.3 No proceedings of any kind may be taken in relation to any action or non-action by the umpires, except as permitted in rule C9.2.\\n\\n C10 SCORING\\n\\n C10.1 The winning competitor of each match scores one point (half a point\\n each for a dead heat); the loser scores no points.\\n\\n C10.2 When a competitor withdraws from part of an event the scores of all\\n completed races shall stand.\\n\\n C10.3 When a single round robin is terminated before completion, or a\\n multiple round robin is terminated during the first round robin, a competitor's score shall be the average points scored per match sailed by the competitor. However, if any of the competitors have completed less than one third of the scheduled matches, the entire round robin shall be disregarded and, if necessary, the event declared void. For the purposes of tie-breaking in rule C11.1(a), a competitor’s score shall be the average points scored per match between the tied competitors.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n C10.4 When a multiple round robin is terminated with an incomplete round\\n robin, only one point shall be available for all the matches sailed between any two competitors, as follows:\\n\\n\\n###### Number of matches completed between any two competitors\\n\\n\\n###### Points for each win\\n\\n\\n###### 1 One point\\n\\n 2 Half a point\\n\\n 3 A third of a point\\n\\n (etc.)\\n\\n C10.5 In a round-robin series,\\n\\n (a) competitors shall be placed in order of their total scores, highest score first;\\n\\n (b) a competitor who has won a match but is disqualified for breaking a rule against a competitor in another match shall lose the point for that match (but the losing competitor shall not be awarded the point); and\\n\\n (c) the overall position between competitors who have sailed in different groups shall be decided by the highest score.\\n\\n C10.6 In a knockout series the sailing instructions shall state the minimum\\n number of points required to win a series between two competitors. When a knockout series is terminated it shall be decided in favour of the competitor with the higher score.\\n\\n C10.7 When only one boat in a match fails to sail the course, she shall be\\n scored no points (without a hearing). \\n\\n C11 TIES\\n\\n C11.1 Round-Robin Series\\n\\n In a round-robin series competitors are assigned to one or more groups and scheduled to sail against all other competitors in their group one or more times. Each separate stage identified in the event format shall be a separate round-robin series irrespective of the number of times each competitor sails against each other competitor in that stage.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n Ties between two or more competitors in a round-robin series shall be broken by the following methods, in order, until all ties are broken. When one or more ties are only partially broken, rules C11.1(a) to C11.1(e) shall be reapplied to them. Ties shall be decided in favour of the competitor(s) who\\n\\n (a) placed in order, has the highest score in the matches between the tied competitors;\\n\\n (b) when the tie is between two competitors in a multiple round robin, has won the last match between the two competitors;\\n\\n (c) has the most points against the competitor placed highest in the round-robin series or, if necessary, second highest, and so on until the tie is broken. When two separate ties have to be resolved but the resolution of each depends upon resolving the other, the following principles shall be used in the rule C11.1(c) procedure:\\n\\n (1) the higher-place tie shall be resolved before the lower- place tie, and\\n\\n (2) all the competitors in the lower-place tie shall be treated as a single competitor for the purposes of rule C11.1(c);\\n\\n (d) after applying rule C10.5(c), has the highest place in the different groups, irrespective of the number of competitors in each group;\\n\\n (e) has the highest place in the most recent stage of the event (fleet race, round robin, etc.).\\n\\n C11.2 Knockout Series\\n\\n Ties (including 0–0) between competitors in a knockout series shall be broken by the following methods, in order, until the tie is broken. The tie shall be decided in favour of the competitor who\\n\\n (a) has the highest place in the most recent round-robin series, applying rule C11.1 if necessary;\\n\\n (b) has won the most recent match in the event between the tied competitors.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n C11.3 Remaining Ties\\n\\n When rule C11.1 or C11.2 does not resolve a tie,\\n\\n (a) if the tie needs to be resolved for a later stage of the event (or another event for which the event is a direct qualifier), the tie shall be broken by a sail-off when practicable. When the race committee decides that a sail-off is not practicable, the tie shall be decided in favour of the competitor who has the highest score in the round-robin series after eliminating the score for the first race for each tied competitor or, should this fail to break the tie, the second race for each tied competitor and so on until the tie is broken. When a tie is partially resolved, the remaining tie shall be broken by reapplying rule C11.1 or C11.2.\\n\\n (b) to decide the winner of an event that is not a direct qualifier  for another event, or the overall position between competitors eliminated in one round of a knockout series, a sail-off may be used (but not a draw).\\n\\n (c) when a tie is not broken any monetary prizes or ranking points for tied places shall be added together and divided equally among the tied competitors.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX D\\n#### TEAM RACING RULES\\n\\n###### Team races shall be sailed under The Racing Rules of Sailing as changed by this appendix.\\n\\n D1 CHANGES TO THE RACING RULES\\n\\n D1.1 Definitions and the Rules of Parts 2 and 4\\n\\n (a) In the definition Zone the distance is changed to two hull lengths. \\n\\n (b) Rule 18.2(b) is changed to:\\n\\n If boats are overlapped when the first of them reaches the zone, the outside boat at that moment shall thereafter give the inside boat mark-room.

The term ‘boat’ elsewhere in the racing rules means ‘kiteboard’ or ‘boat’ as appropriate. \\n\\n Note: Rules for other kiteboarding racing formats (such as Short Track, Kitecross, Slalom, Boarder X) or other kiteboarding competitions (such as Freestyle, Wave, Big Air, Speed) are not included in this appendix. Links to current versions of these rules can be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS\\n\\n The definitions Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap, Finish, Keep Clear, Leeward and Windward, Mark-Room, Obstruction, Start, Tack, Starboard or Port and Zone are changed to:\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One kiteboard is clear astern of another when her hull is behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other kiteboard’s hull. The other kiteboard is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a kiteboard between them overlaps both. If there is reasonable doubt that two kiteboards are overlapped, it shall be presumed that they are not. These terms always apply to kiteboards on the same tack. They apply to kiteboards on opposite tacks only when both kiteboards are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind. \\n\\n Finish A kiteboard finishes when, after starting, while the competitor is in contact with the hull, any part of her hull, or the competitor, crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she \\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2, \\n\\n (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or \\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### Keep Clear  A kiteboard keeps clear of a right-of-way kiteboard\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way kiteboard can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and, \\n\\n (b) when the kiteboards are overlapped, if the right-of-way kiteboard can also change course in both directions or move her kite in any direction without immediately making contact.\\n\\n Leeward and Windward  A kiteboard’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her kite lies. The other side is her windward side. When two kiteboards on the same tack overlap, the one whose hull is on the leeward side of the other’s hull is the leeward kiteboard. The other is the windward kiteboard.\\n\\n Mark-Room  Room for a kiteboard to sail her proper course to round or pass the mark on the required side. \\n\\n Obstruction  An object that a kiteboard could not pass without substantially changing her course or the position of her kite, if she were sailing directly towards it and 10 metres from it. An object that can be safely passed on only one side and an object, area or line so designated by the sailing instructions are also obstructions. However, a kiteboard racing is not an obstruction to other kiteboards unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. A vessel under way, including a kiteboard racing, is never a continuing obstruction. \\n\\n Start  A kiteboard starts when, her hull and the competitor having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, and having complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, any part of her hull or the competitor crosses the starting line from the pre- start side to the course side.\\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port  A kiteboard is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to the competitor’s hand that would be forward if the competitor were in normal riding position (riding heel side with both hands on the control bar and arms not crossed). A kiteboard is on starboard tack when the competitor’s right hand would be forward and is on the port tack when the competitor’s left hand would be forward. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n Zone  The area around a mark within a distance of 30 metres. A kiteboard is in the zone when any part of her hull is in the zone. \\n\\n Add the following definitions: \\n\\n Capsized  A kiteboard is capsized if\\n\\n (a) her kite is in the water, or\\n\\n (b) her lines are tangled with another kiteboard’s lines. \\n\\n Jumping  A kiteboard is jumping when her hull, its appendages and the competitor are clear of the water. \\n\\n Recovering\\n\\n (a) A kiteboard is recovering from the time she loses steerage way until she regains it, unless she is capsized. \\n\\n (b) A kiteboard is recovering from the time her kite is out of the water until she has steerage way.\\n\\n F1 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 1\\n\\n [No changes.]\\n\\n F2 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 2\\n\\n PART 2 — PREAMBLE\\n\\n In the second sentence of the preamble, ‘injury or serious damage’ is changed to ‘injury, serious damage or a tangle’. \\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n Rule 13 is deleted. \\n\\n 16 CHANGING COURSE OR KITE POSITION\\n\\n Rule 16 is changed to:\\n\\n 16.1 When a right-of-way kiteboard changes course or the position of\\n her kite, she shall give the other kiteboard room to continue keeping clear.\\n\\n 16.2 In addition, on a beat to windward when a port-tack kiteboard is\\n keeping clear by sailing to pass to leeward of a starboard-tack kiteboard, the starboard-tack kiteboard shall not bear away or change the position of her kite if as a result the port-tack\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### kiteboard must change course or the position of her kite immediately to continue keeping clear. \\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK; PROPER COURSE\\n\\n Rule 17 is deleted.\\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n Rule 18 is changed to:\\n\\n 18.1 When Rule 18 Applies\\n\\n Rule 18 applies between kiteboards when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is in the zone. However, it does not apply\\n\\n (a) between a kiteboard approaching a mark and one leaving it, or\\n\\n (b) between kiteboards on opposite tacks.\\n\\n Rule 18 no longer applies between kiteboards when mark-room has been given. \\n\\n 18.2 Giving Mark-Room\\n\\n (a) When the first kiteboard reaches the zone,\\n\\n (1) if kiteboards are overlapped, the outside kiteboard at that moment shall thereafter give the inside kiteboard mark-room.\\n\\n (2) if kiteboards are not overlapped, the kiteboard that has not reached the zone shall thereafter give mark- room.\\n\\n (b) If the kiteboard entitled to mark-room leaves the zone, the entitlement to mark-room ceases and rule 18.2(a) is applied again if required based on the relationship of the kiteboards at the time rule 18.2(a) is re-applied.\\n\\n (c) If a kiteboard obtained an inside overlap and, from the time the overlap began, the outside kiteboard is unable to give mark-room, she is not required to give it. \\n\\n 18.3 Tacking and Gybing\\n\\n When an inside overlapped right-of-way kiteboard must change tack at a mark to sail her proper course, until she changes tack she shall sail no farther from the mark than needed to sail that\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### course. Rule 18.3 does not apply at a gate mark or a finishing mark and a kiteboard shall not be penalized for breaking this rule unless the course of another kiteboard was affected by the breach of this rule.\\n\\n 20 ROOM TO TACK AT AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n Rule 20.1(a) is changed to:\\n\\n (a) she is approaching an obstruction, and, to avoid it safely, will soon need to make a substantial change of her course or the position of her kite, and \\n\\n Add new rule 20.5:\\n\\n 20.5 Arm Signals \\n\\n The following arm signals are required in addition to the hails\\n\\n (a) for room to tack, repeatedly and clearly circling one hand over the head; and \\n\\n (b) for ‘You tack’, repeatedly and clearly pointing at the other kiteboard and waving the arm to windward. \\n\\n SECTION D — PREAMBLE\\n\\n The preamble to Section D is changed to:\\n\\n When rule 21 or 22 applies between two kiteboards, Section A and C rules do not.\\n\\n 21 STARTING ERRORS; TAKING PENALTIES; JUMPING\\n\\n Rule 21.3 is changed and new rule 21.4 is added: \\n\\n 21.3 During the last minute before her starting signal, a kiteboard that\\n stops, slows down significantly, or one that is not making significant forward progress shall keep clear of all others unless she is accidentally capsized.\\n\\n 21.4 A kiteboard that is jumping shall keep clear of one that is not. \\n\\n 22 CAPSIZED; RECOVERING; AGROUND; RESCUING \\n\\n Rule 22 is changed to:\\n\\n 22.1 If possible, a kiteboard shall avoid a kiteboard that is capsized,\\n is aground, or is trying to help a person or vessel in danger. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n 22.2 A kiteboard that is recovering shall keep clear of a kiteboard that\\n is not. \\n\\n F3 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 3\\n\\n 26 STARTING RACES\\n\\n Rule 26 is changed to:\\n\\n Races shall be started by using the following signals. Times shall be taken from the visual signals; the absence of a sound signal shall be disregarded.\\n\\n\\n###### Minutes before starting signal\\n\\n\\n###### Visual signal Sound signal\\n\\n\\n###### Means\\n\\n\\n###### 3 Class flag One Warning signal\\n 2 U or black flag One Preparatory signal\\n\\n\\n###### 1 U or black flag removed\\n 0 Class flag removed\\n\\n 29 RECALLS\\n\\n Rule 29.1 is deleted. \\n\\n 30 STARTING PENALTIES\\n\\n Rules 30.1 and 30.2 are deleted.\\n\\n\\n###### One long One minute\\n One Starting signal \\n\\n\\n###### In rules 30.3 and 30.4, ‘hull’ is changed to ‘hull or competitor. \\n\\n In rule 30.4, ‘sail number’ is changed to ‘competitor number’.\\n\\n 31 TOUCHING A MARK\\n\\n Rule 31 is changed to:\\n\\n While racing, a kiteboard shall not touch a windward mark. \\n\\n 36 RACES RESTARTED OR RESAILED\\n\\n Rule 36(b) is changed to:\\n\\n (b) cause a kiteboard to be penalized except under rule 2, 30.2, 30.4 or 69 or under rule 14 when she has caused injury, serious damage or a tangle. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n F4 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 4\\n\\n 41 OUTSIDE HELP\\n\\n Add new rules 41(e) and 41(f):\\n\\n (e) help from another competitor in the same race to assist a relaunch; \\n\\n (f) help to change equipment, but only in the launching area. \\n\\n 42 PROPULSION\\n\\n Rule 42 is changed to:\\n\\n 42.1 Basic Rule\\n\\n Except when permitted in rule 42.2, a kiteboard shall compete by using only the wind and water to increase, maintain or decrease her speed.\\n\\n 42.2 Exceptions\\n\\n (a) A kiteboard may be propelled by unassisted actions of the competitor on the kiteboard.\\n\\n (b) A competitor may swim, walk or paddle while capsized or recovering, provided that the kiteboard does not gain a significant advantage in the race.\\n\\n (c) Any means of propulsion may be used to help a person or another vessel in danger. \\n\\n 43 EXONERATION\\n\\n Rule 43.1(c) is changed to: \\n\\n (c) A right-of-way kiteboard, or one sailing within the room or mark-room to which she is entitled, is exonerated for breaking rule 14 if the contact does not cause damage, injury or a tangle. \\n\\n Add new rule 43.1(d):\\n\\n (d) When a kiteboard breaks rule 15 and there is no contact, she is exonerated for her breach. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### 44 PENALTIES AT THE TIME OF AN INCIDENT\\n\\n Rules 44.1 and 44.2 are changed to:\\n\\n 44.1 Taking a Penalty\\n\\n A kiteboard may take a One-Turn Penalty when she may have broken one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31 in an incident while racing. Alternatively, the notice of race or sailing instructions may specify the use of the Scoring Penalty or some other penalty, in which case the specified penalty shall replace the One-Turn Penalty. However, \\n\\n (a) when a kiteboard may have broken a rule of Part 2 and rule 31 in the same incident she need not take the penalty for breaking rule 31; and\\n\\n (b) if the kiteboard caused injury, damage or a tangle or, despite taking a penalty, gained a significant advantage or caused significant disadvantage to the other kiteboard in the race or series by her breach, her penalty shall be to retire. \\n\\n 44.2 One-Turn Penalty\\n\\n After getting well clear of other kiteboards as soon after the incident as possible, a kiteboard takes a One-Turn Penalty by promptly making one turn with her hull appendage in the water. The turn shall include one completed tack and one completed gybe.

Alternatively, if permitted in the class rules, an owner may be allotted a personal sail number by the relevant issuing authority, which may be used on all his boats in that class.\\n\\n Sails measured before 31 March 1999 shall comply with rule G1.1 or with the rules applicable at the time of measurement.\\n\\n Note: An up-to-date version of the table below is available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### NATIONAL SAIL LETTERS \\n\\n National authority Letters\\n Algeria ALG\\n American Samoa  ASA \\n Andorra  AND \\n Angola ANG \\n Antigua  ANT \\n Argentina  ARG \\n Armenia ARM\\n Aruba ARU\\n Australia  AUS \\n Austria  AUT \\n Azerbaijan AZE\\n Bahamas  BAH \\n Bahrain  BRN \\n Barbados  BAR \\n Belarus  BLR \\n Belgium  BEL \\n Belize BIZ\\n Bermuda  BER \\n Brazil  BRA \\n Botswana BOT\\n British Virgin Islands IVB\\n Brunei Darussalam BRU\\n Bulgaria  BUL \\n Cambodia CAM\\n Canada  CAN \\n Cayman Islands CAY\\n Chile  CHI \\n China, PR  CHN \\n Chinese Taipei  TPE \\n Colombia  COL \\n Cook Islands  COK \\n Croatia  CRO \\n Cuba  CUB \\n Cyprus  CYP \\n Czech Republic  CZE \\n Denmark  DEN \\n\\n\\n###### National authority Letters\\n Djibouti DJI\\n Dominican Republic DOM\\n Ecuador ECU\\n Egypt  EGY \\n El Salvador  ESA \\n Estonia  EST \\n Fiji  FIJ \\n Finland  FIN \\n France  FRA \\n Georgia GEO\\n Germany  GER \\n Great Britain  GBR \\n Greece  GRE \\n Grenada  GRN \\n Guam  GUM \\n Guatemala  GUA \\n Hong Kong, China  HKG \\n Hungary  HUN \\n Iceland  ISL \\n India  IND \\n Indonesia  INA \\n Iran IRN\\n Iraq IRQ\\n Ireland  IRL \\n Israel  ISR \\n Italy  ITA \\n Jamaica  JAM \\n Japan  JPN \\n Kazakhstan KAZ\\n Kenya  KEN \\n Korea, DPR PRK\\n Korea, Republic of  KOR \\n Kosovo KOS\\n Kuwait  KUW \\n Kyrgyzstan KGZ\\n Latvia  LAT \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### National authority Letters\\n Lebanon  LIB \\n Libya  LBA \\n Liechtenstein  LIE \\n Lithuania LTU\\n Luxembourg  LUX \\n Macau, China MAC\\n Madagascar MAD\\n Malaysia MAS\\n Malta  MLT \\n Mauritius MRI \\n Mexico MEX \\n Moldova  MDA \\n Monaco  MON \\n Montenegro  MNE \\n Montserrat MNT\\n Morocco MAR\\n Mozambique MOZ \\n Myanmar MYA\\n Namibia NAM\\n Netherlands  NED \\n Netherlands Antilles AHO \\n New Zealand NZL\\n Nigeria  NGR \\n North Macedonia MKD\\n Norway  NOR \\n Oman OMA\\n Pakistan  PAK \\n Palestine PLE\\n Panama PAN\\n Papua New Guinea  PNG \\n Paraguay  PAR \\n Peru  PER \\n Philippines  PHI \\n Poland  POL \\n Portugal  POR \\n Puerto Rico  PUR \\n Qatar  QAT \\n\\n\\n###### National authority Letters\\n Romania ROM\\n Russia RUS\\n Samoa SAM\\n San Marino  SMR \\n Senegal SEN\\n Serbia SRB\\n Seychelles  SEY \\n Singapore  SGP\\n Slovak Republic  SVK \\n Slovenia  SLO \\n South Africa  RSA \\n Spain  ESP \\n Sri Lanka  SRI \\n St Kitts & Nevis SKN\\n St Lucia  LCA \\n Sudan SUD\\n Sweden SWE\\n Switzerland  SUI \\n Tahiti  TAH \\n Tanzania TAN\\n Thailand  THA \\n Timor Leste TLS\\n Trinidad & Tobago  TTO \\n Tunisia  TUN \\n Turkey  TUR \\n Turks & Caicos TKS\\n Uganda UGA\\n Ukraine  UKR \\n United Arab Emirates UAE\\n United States of America USA\\n Uruguay  URU \\n US Virgin Islands  ISV \\n Vanuatu VAN\\n Venezuela  VEN \\n Vietnam VIE\\n Zimbabwe  ZIM \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n G1.2 Specifications\\n\\n (a) National letters and sail numbers shall be:\\n\\n (1) in capital letters and Arabic numerals,\\n\\n (2) of the same colour,\\n\\n (3) of a contrasting colour to the body of the sail, and\\n\\n (4) of a sans-serif typeface. \\n\\n In addition, the letters and numbers identifying the boat shall be clearly legible when the sail is set. \\n\\n (b) The height of characters and space between adjoining characters on the same and opposite sides of the sail shall be related to the boat’s overall length as follows:\\n\\n Overall length Minimum height Minimum space  between characters and from edge of sail\\n\\n Under 3.5 m 230 mm 45 mm\\n\\n 3.5 m – 8.5 m 300 mm 60 mm\\n\\n 8.5 m – 11 m 375 mm 75 mm\\n\\n Over 11 m 450 mm 90 mm\\n\\n G1.3 Positioning\\n\\n Class insignia, national letters and sail numbers shall be positioned as follows:\\n\\n (a) General\\n\\n (1) Class insignia, national letters and sail numbers, where applicable, shall be place on both sides and such that those on the starboard side are uppermost.\\n\\n (2) National letters shall be placed above the sail numbers on each side of the sail.\\n\\n (b) Mainsails\\n\\n (1) The class insignia, national letters and sail numbers shall, if possible, be wholly above an arc whose centre is the head point and whose radius is 60% of the leech length.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n (2) The class insignia shall be placed above the national letters.

It is addressed primarily to protest committee chairmen but may also help judges, protest committee secretaries, race committees and others connected with protest and redress hearings.\\n\\n In a protest or redress hearing, the protest committee should weigh all testimony with equal care; should recognize that honest testimony can vary, and even be in conflict, as a result of different observations and recollections; should resolve such differences as best it can; should recognize that no boat or competitor is guilty until a breach of a rule has been established to the satisfaction of the protest committee; and should keep an open mind until all the evidence has been heard as to whether a boat or competitor has broken a rule.\\n\\n M1 PRELIMINARIES (may be performed by race office staff)\\n\\n ● Receive the protest or request for redress.\\n\\n ● Note on the form the time the protest or request is delivered and the protest time limit.\\n\\n ● Inform each party, and the race committee when necessary, when and where the hearing will be held.\\n\\n M2 BEFORE THE HEARING\\n\\n M2.1 Make sure that\\n\\n ● each party has a copy of or the opportunity to read the protest, request for redress or allegation and has had reasonable time to prepare for the hearing. \\n\\n ● only one person from each boat (or party) is present unless an interpreter is needed.\\n\\n ● all boats and people involved are represented. If they are not, however, the committee may proceed under rule 63.3(b).\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n ● boats’ representatives were on board when required (rule 63.3(a)). When the parties were in different events, both organizing authorities must accept the composition of the protest committee (rule 63.8). In a protest concerning class rules, obtain the current class rules and identify the authority responsible for interpreting them (rule 64.4(b)). \\n\\n M2.2 Determine if any members of the protest committee saw the incident. If so, require each of them to state that fact in the presence of the parties (rule 63.6(b)). \\n\\n M2.3 Assess conflicts of interest.\\n\\n ● Ensure that all protest committee members declare any possible conflicts of interest. At major events this will often be a formal written declaration made before the event starts that will be kept with the protest committee records.\\n\\n ● At the start of any hearing, ensure that the parties are aware of any conflicts of interest of protest committee members. Ask the parties if they consent to the members. If a party does not object as soon as possible after a conflict of interest has been declared, the protest committee may take this as consent to proceed and should record it.\\n\\n ● If a party objects to a member, the remainder of the protest committee members need to assess whether the conflict of interest is significant. The assessment will consider the level of the event, the level of the conflict and the perception of fairness. It may be acceptable to balance conflicts between protest committee members. Guidance may be found on the World Sailing website. Record the decision and the grounds for that decision.\\n\\n ● In cases of doubt it may be preferable to proceed with a smaller protest committee. Except for hearings under rule 69, there is no minimum number of protest committee members required.\\n\\n ● When a request for redress is made under rule 62.1(a) and is based on an improper action or omission of a body other than the protest committee, a member of that body should not be a member of the protest committee. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M3 THE HEARING\\n\\n M3.1 Check the validity of the protest or request for redress.\\n\\n ● Are the contents adequate (rule 61.2 or 62)?\\n\\n ● Was it delivered in time? If not, is there good reason to extend the time limit (rule 61.3 or 62.2)?\\n\\n ● When required, was the protestor involved in or a witness to the incident (rule 60.1(a))?\\n\\n ● When necessary, was ‘Protest’ hailed and, if required, a red flag displayed correctly (rule 61.1(a))?\\n\\n ● When the flag or hail was not necessary, was the protestee informed?\\n\\n ● Decide whether the protest or request for redress is valid (rule 63.5).\\n\\n ● Once the validity of the protest or request has been determined, do not let the subject be introduced again unless truly new evidence is available.\\n\\n M3.2 Take the evidence (rule 63.6).\\n\\n ● Ask the protestor and then the protestee to tell their stories. Then allow them to question one another. In a redress matter, ask the party to state the request.\\n\\n ● Make sure you know what facts each party is alleging before calling any witnesses. Their stories may be different.\\n\\n ● Allow anyone, including a boat’s crew, to give evidence. It is the party who normally decides which witnesses to call, although the protest committee may also call witnesses (rule 63.6(a)). The question asked by a party ‘Would you like to hear N?’ is best answered by ‘It is your choice.’\\n\\n ● Call each party’s witnesses (and the protest committee’s if any) one by one. Limit parties to questioning the witness(es). (They may wander into general statements.)\\n\\n ● Invite the protestee to question the protestor’s witness first (and vice versa). This prevents the protestor from leading his witness from the beginning.\\n\\n ● Allow members of the protest committee who saw the incident to give evidence (rule 63.6(b)), but only while the parties are\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n present. Members who give evidence may be questioned, should take care to relate all they know about the incident that could affect the decision, and may remain on the protest committee (rule 63.3(a)).\\n\\n ● Try to prevent leading questions, but if that is impossible discount the evidence so obtained. \\n\\n ● The protest committee chairman should advise a party or a witness giving hearsay, repetitive or irrelevant evidence that the protest committee must give such evidence appropriate weight, which may be little or no weight at all. \\n\\n ● Accept written evidence from a witness who is not available to be questioned only if all parties agree. In doing so they forego their rights to question that witness (rule 63.6(c)). \\n\\n ● Ask one member of the committee to note down evidence, particularly times, distances, speeds, etc.\\n\\n ● Invite questions from protest committee members. \\n\\n ● Invite first the protestor and then the protestee to make a final statement of her case, particularly on any application or interpretation of the rules.\\n\\n M3.3 Find the facts (rule 63.6(d)). \\n\\n ● Write down the facts; resolve doubts one way or the other.\\n\\n ● Call back parties for more questions if necessary.\\n\\n ● When appropriate, draw a diagram of the incident using the facts you have found.\\n\\n M3.4 Decide the case (rule 64).\\n\\n ● Base the decision on the facts found. (If you cannot, find some more facts.)\\n\\n ● In redress cases, make sure that no further evidence is needed from boats that will be affected by the decision.\\n\\n M3.5 Inform the parties (rule 65).\\n\\n ● Recall the parties and read them the facts found, conclusions and rules that apply, and the decision. When time presses it is permissible to read the decision and give the details later.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n ● Give any party a copy of the decision on request. File the protest or request for redress with the committee records.\\n\\n M4 REOPENING A HEARING (rule 66)\\n\\n M4.1 When a party, within the time limit, has asked for a hearing to be reopened, hear the party making the request, look at any video, etc., and decide whether there is any significant new evidence that might lead you to change your decision. Decide whether your interpretation of the rules may have been wrong; be open-minded as to whether you have made a mistake. If none of these applies refuse to reopen; otherwise schedule a hearing.\\n\\n M4.2 Evidence is ‘new’\\n\\n ● if it was not reasonably possible for the party asking for the reopening to have discovered the evidence before the original hearing,\\n\\n ● if the protest committee is satisfied that before the original hearing the evidence was diligently but unsuccessfully sought by the party asking for the reopening, or\\n\\n ● if the protest committee learns from any source that the evidence was not available to the parties at the time of the original hearing.\\n\\n M5 MISCONDUCT (rule 69) \\n\\n M5.1 An action under this rule is not a protest, but the protest committee gives its allegations in writing to the competitor before the hearing. The hearing is conducted under rules similar to those governing a protest hearing but the protest committee must have at least three members (rule 69.2(a)). Use the greatest care to protect the competitor’s rights.\\n\\n M5.2 A competitor or a boat cannot protest under rule 69, but the hearing request form of a competitor who tries to do so may be accepted as a report to the protest committee, which can then decide whether or not to call a hearing.\\n\\n M5.3 Unless World Sailing has appointed a person for the role, the protest committee may appoint a person to present the allegation. This person might be a race official, the person making the allegation or other appropriate person. When no reasonable alternative person is\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n available, a person who was appointed as a member of the protest committee may present the allegation.\\n\\n M5.4 When it is desirable to call a hearing under rule 69 as a result of a Part 2 incident, it is important to hear any boat-vs.-boat protest in the normal way, deciding which boat, if any, broke which rule, before proceeding against the competitor under rule 69.\\n\\n M5.5 Although action under rule 69 is taken against a competitor, boat owner or support person, and not a boat, a boat may also be penalized (rules 69.2(h)(2) and 64.5).\\n\\n M5.6 When a protest committee upholds a rule 69 allegation it will need to consider if it is appropriate to report to either a national authority or World Sailing. Guidance on when to report may be found in the World Sailing Case Book. When the protest committee does make a report it may recommend whether or not further action should be taken.\\n\\n M5.7 Unless the right of appeal is denied in accordance with rule 70.5, a party to a rule 69 hearing may appeal the decision of the protest committee.\\n\\n M5.8 Further guidance for protest committees about misconduct may be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n M6 APPEALS (rule 70 and Appendix R)\\n\\n When decisions can be appealed,\\n\\n ● retain the papers relevant to the hearing so that the information can easily be used for an appeal. Is there a diagram endorsed or prepared by the protest committee? Are the facts found sufficient? (Example: Was there an overlap? Yes or No. ‘Perhaps’ is not a fact found.) Are the names of the protest committee members and other important information on the form?\\n\\n ● comments by the protest committee on any appeal should enable the appeals committee to picture the whole incident clearly; the appeals committee knows nothing about the situation.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M7 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE\\n\\n Photographs and videos can sometimes provide useful evidence but protest committees should recognize their limitations and note the following points:\\n\\n ● The party producing the photographic evidence is responsible for arranging the viewing.\\n\\n ● View the video several times to extract all the information from it.\\n\\n ● The depth perception of any single-lens camera is very poor; with a telephoto lens it is non-existent. When the camera views two overlapped boats at right angles to their course, it is impossible to assess the distance between them. When the camera views them head on, it is impossible to see whether an overlap exists unless it is substantial.\\n\\n ● Ask the following questions:\\n\\n • Where was the camera in relation to the boats?\\n\\n • Was the camera’s platform moving? If so in what direction and how fast?\\n\\n • Is the angle changing as the boats approach the critical point? Fast panning causes radical change.\\n\\n • Did the camera have an unrestricted view throughout?\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX N\\n\\n#### INTERNATIONAL JURIES\\n\\n###### See rules 70.5 and 91(b). This appendix shall not be changed by the notice of race, sailing instructions or national prescriptions.\\n\\n N1 COMPOSITION, APPOINTMENT AND ORGANIZATION\\n\\n N1.1 An international jury shall be composed of experienced sailors with excellent knowledge of the racing rules and extensive protest committee experience. It shall be independent of and have no members from the race committee or the technical committee, and it shall be appointed by the organizing authority, subject to approval by the national authority if required (see rule 91(b)), or by World Sailing under rule 89.2(c).\\n\\n N1.2 The jury shall consist of a chairman, a vice chairman if desired, and other members for a total of at least five. A majority shall be International Judges. \\n\\n N1.3 No more than two members (three, in Groups M, N and Q) shall be from the same national authority.\\n\\n N1.4 (a) The chairman of a jury may appoint one or more panels composed in compliance with rules N1.1, N1.2 and N1.3. This can be done even if the full jury is not composed in compliance with these rules.\\n\\n (b) The chairman of a jury may appoint panels of at least three members each, of which the majority shall be International Judges. Members of each panel shall be from at least three different national authorities except in Groups M, N and Q, where they shall be from at least two different national authorities. If dissatisfied with a panel’s decision, a party is entitled to a hearing by a panel composed in compliance with rules N1.1, N1.2 and N1.3, except concerning the facts found, if requested within 30 minutes or the time limit specified in the sailing instructions.\\n\\n N1.5 When a full jury, or a panel, has fewer than five members, because of illness or emergency, and no qualified replacements are available, it remains properly constituted if it consists of at least three members and if at least two of them are International Judges. When there are\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n three or four members they shall be from at least three different national authorities except in Groups M, N and Q, where they shall be from at least two different national authorities.\\n\\n N1.6 When it is considered desirable that some members not participate in discussing and deciding a protest or request for redress, and no qualified replacements are available, the jury or panel remains properly constituted if at least three members remain and at least two of them are International Judges.\\n\\n N1.7 In exception to rules N1.1 and N1.2, World Sailing may in limited circumstances (see World Sailing Regulation 25.8.13) authorize an international jury consisting of a total of only three members. All members shall be International Judges. The members shall be from three different national authorities (two, in Groups M, N and Q). The authorization shall be stated in a letter of approval to the organizing authority and in the notice of race or sailing instructions, and the letter shall be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n N1.8 When the national authority’s approval is required for the appointment of an international jury (see rule 91(b)), notice of its approval shall be included in the sailing instructions or be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n N1.9 If the jury or a panel acts while not properly constituted, its decisions may be appealed.\\n\\n N2 RESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\n N2.1 An international jury is responsible for hearing and deciding all protests, requests for redress and other matters arising under the rules of Part 5. When asked by the organizing authority, the race committee or the technical committee, it shall advise and assist them on any matter directly affecting the fairness of the competition.\\n\\n N2.2 Unless the organizing authority directs otherwise, the jury shall decide\\n\\n (a) questions of eligibility, measurement or rating certificates; and \\n\\n (b) whether to authorize the substitution of competitors, boats or equipment when a rule requires such a decision.\\n\\n N2.3 The jury shall also decide matters referred to it by the organizing authority, the race committee or the technical committee. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n N3 PROCEDURES \\n\\n N3.1 Members shall not be regarded as having a significant conflict of interest (see rule 63.4) by reason of their nationality, club membership or similar. When otherwise considering a significant conflict of interest as required by rule 63.4, considerable weight must be given to the fact that decisions of an international jury cannot be appealed and this may affect the perception of fairness and lower the level of conflict that is significant. In case of doubt, the hearing should proceed as permitted by rule N1.6. \\n\\n N3.2 If a panel fails to agree on a decision it may adjourn, in which case the chairman shall refer the matter to a properly constituted panel with as many members as possible, which may be the full jury.\\n\\n N4 MISCONDUCT (Rule 69) \\n\\n N4.1 The World Sailing Disciplinary Code contains procedures that apply to specific international events with regard to the appointment of a person to conduct any investigation. These procedures override any conflicting provision of this appendix. \\n\\n N4.2 A person shall be responsible for presenting to the hearing panel any allegations of misconduct under rule 69. This person shall not be a member of the hearing panel but may be a member of the jury. Such a person shall be required to make full disclosure of all material that may come into his possession in the course of his investigation to the person subject to allegations of a breach of rule 69. \\n\\n N4.3 Prior to a hearing, the hearing panel, to the extent practically possible, shall not act as an investigator of any allegations made under rule 69. However, during the hearing the panel shall be entitled to ask any investigative questions it may see fit. \\n\\n N4.4 If the panel decides to call a hearing, all material disclosed to the panel in order for them to make that decision must be disclosed to the person subject to the allegations before the hearing begins. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX P\\n\\n#### SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR RULE 42\\n\\n###### All or part of this appendix applies only if the notice of race or sailing instructions so state.\\n\\n P1 OBSERVERS AND PROCEDURE\\n\\n P1.1 The protest committee may appoint observers, including protest committee members, to act in accordance with rule P1.2. A person with a significant conflict of interest shall not be appointed as an observer. \\n\\n P1.2 An observer appointed under rule P1.1 who sees a boat breaking rule 42 may penalize her by, as soon as reasonably possible, making a sound signal, pointing a yellow flag at her and hailing her sail number, even if she is no longer racing. A boat so penalized shall not be penalized a second time under rule 42 for the same incident. \\n\\n P2 PENALTIES\\n\\n P2.1 First Penalty\\n\\n When a boat is first penalized under rule P1.2 her penalty shall be a Two-Turns Penalty under rule 44.2. If she fails to take it she shall be disqualified without a hearing.\\n\\n P2.2 Second Penalty\\n\\n When a boat is penalized a second time during the event, she shall promptly retire. If she fails to do so she shall be disqualified without a hearing and her score shall not be excluded. \\n\\n P2.3 Third and Subsequent Penalties\\n\\n When a boat is penalized a third or subsequent time during the event, she shall promptly retire. If she does so her penalty shall be disqualification without a hearing and her score shall not be excluded. If she fails to do so her penalty shall be disqualification without a hearing from all races in the event, with no score excluded, and the protest committee shall consider calling a hearing under rule 69.2.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n P2.4 Penalties Near the Finishing Line\\n\\n If a boat is penalized under rule P2.2 or P2.3 and it was not reasonably possible for her to retire before finishing, she shall be scored as if she had retired promptly. \\n\\n P3 POSTPONEMENT, GENERAL RECALL OR ABANDONMENT\\n\\n If a boat has been penalized under rule P1.2 and the race committee signals a postponement, general recall or abandonment, the penalty is cancelled, but it is still counted to determine the number of times she has been penalized during the event. \\n\\n P4 REDRESS LIMITATION\\n\\n A boat shall not be given redress for an action by a member of the protest committee or its designated observer under rule P1.2 unless the action was improper due to a failure to take into account a race committee signal or a class rule.\\n\\n P5 FLAGS O AND R\\n\\n P5.1 When Rule P5 Applies\\n\\n Rule P5 applies if the class rules permit pumping, rocking and ooching when the wind speed exceeds a specified limit.\\n\\n P5.2 Before the Starting Signal\\n\\n (a) The race committee may signal that pumping, rocking and ooching are permitted, as specified in the class rules, by displaying flag O before or with the warning signal.\\n\\n (b) If the wind speed becomes less than the specified limit after flag O has been displayed, the race committee may postpone the race. Then, before or with a new warning signal, the committee shall display either flag R, to signal that rule 42 as changed by the class rules applies, or flag O, as provided in rule P5.2(a).\\n\\n (c) If flag O or flag R is displayed before or with the warning signal, it shall be displayed until the starting signal.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n P5.3 After the Starting Signal\\n\\n After the starting signal,\\n\\n (a) if the wind speed exceeds the specified limit, the race committee may display flag O with repetitive sounds at a mark to signal that pumping, rocking and ooching are permitted, as specified in the class rules, after passing the mark;\\n\\n (b) if flag O has been displayed and the wind speed becomes less than the specified limit, the race committee may display flag R with repetitive sounds at a mark to signal that rule 42, as changed by the class rules, applies after passing the mark. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX R\\n\\n#### PROCEDURES FOR APPEALS  AND REQUESTS\\n\\n###### See rule 70.

Arbitration may not be appropriate for all events as it requires an additional knowledgeable person to act as the arbitrator. Further guidance on arbitration can be found in the World Sailing Judges Manual, which can be downloaded from the World Sailing website.\\n\\n T1 POST-RACE PENALTIES\\n\\n (a) Provided that rule 44.1(b) does not apply, a boat that may have broken one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31 in an incident may take a Post-Race Penalty at any time after the race until the beginning of a protest hearing involving the incident.\\n\\n (b) A Post-Race Penalty is a 30% Scoring Penalty calculated as stated in rule 44.3(c). However, rule 44.1(a) applies.\\n\\n (c) A boat takes a Post-Race Penalty by delivering to the arbitrator or a member of the protest committee a written statement that she accepts the penalty and that identifies the race number and where and when the incident occurred.\\n\\n T2 ARBITRATION MEETING\\n\\n An arbitration meeting will be held prior to a protest hearing for each incident resulting in a protest by a boat involving one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31, but only if each party is represented by a person who was on board at the time of the incident. No witnesses will be permitted. However, if the arbitrator decides that rule 44.1(b) may apply or that arbitration is not appropriate, the meeting will not be held, and if a meeting is in progress, it will be closed.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n T3 ARBITRATOR’S OPINION\\n\\n Based on the evidence given by the representatives, the arbitrator will offer an opinion as to what the protest committee is likely to decide:\\n\\n (a) the protest is invalid,\\n\\n (b) no boat will be penalized for breaking a rule, or\\n\\n (c) one or more boats will be penalized for breaking a rule, identifying the boats and the penalties.\\n\\n T4 ARBITRATION MEETING OUTCOMES\\n\\n After the arbitrator offers an opinion,\\n\\n (a) a boat may take a Post-Race Penalty, and\\n\\n (b) a boat may ask to withdraw her protest. The arbitrator may then act on behalf of the protest committee in accordance with rule 63.1 to allow the withdrawal.\\n\\n Unless all protests involving the incident are withdrawn, a protest hearing will be held.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n-----\\n\\n20 Eastbourne Terrace\\nLondon, W2 6LG\\nUnited Kingdom\\n\\nTel: + 44 (0)2039 404 888\\n\\nwww sailing org\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n![](./images/RRS-2021-2024-Final.pdf-157-0.png)\\n\\n-----\\n\\n\", \"# The Racing Rules of Sailing\\n\\n## 2025-2028\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n### RACE SIGNALS \\n\\n###### The meanings of visual and sound signals are stated below.

The first, Parts 1–7, contains rules that affect all competitors. The second, the appendices, provides details of rules, rules that apply to particular kinds of racing, and rules that affect only a small number of competitors or officials.\\n\\n Terminology  A term used in the sense stated in the Definitions is printed in italics or, in preambles, in bold italics (for example, racing and racing).\\n Each of the terms in the table below is used in The Racing Rules of Sailing with the meaning given.\\n\\n Term Meaning\\n Boat A sailboat and the crew on board, that are subject to the rules. \\n Competitor A person who races or intends to race in the event.\\n National A World Sailing member national authority. authority\\n Race The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) committee and any other person or committee performing a\\n race committee function.\\n Racing rule A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.\\n Technical The technical committee appointed under rule committee 89.2(c) and any other person or committee\\n performing a technical committee function. \\n Vessel Any boat or ship.\\n\\n Other words and terms are used in the sense ordinarily understood in nautical or general use. For a source of the nautical sense of a word, a reader may refer to The Equipment Rules of Sailing.\\n\\n Hails  A language other than English may be used for a hail required by the rules provided that it is reasonable for it to be understood by all boats affected. However, a hail in English is always acceptable.\\n\\n Notation  The notation ‘[DP]’ in a rule means that the penalty for a breach of the rule may, at the discretion of the protest committee, be\\n\\n 5\\n\\n|Sailing with the m|meaning given.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Term|Meaning|\\n|Boat|A sailboat and the crew on board, that are subject to the rules.|\\n|Competitor|A person who races or intends to race in the event.|\\n|National authority|A World Sailing member national authority.|\\n|Race committee|The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a race committee function.|\\n|Racing rule|A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.|\\n|Technical committee|The technical committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a technical committee function.|\\n|Vessel|Any boat or ship.|\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### less than disqualification. Guidelines for discretionary penalties are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Revision  The racing rules are revised and published every four years by World Sailing, the international authority for the sport. This edition becomes effective on 1 January 2025 except that for an event beginning in 2024 the date may be postponed by the notice of race. Marginal markings indicate important changes to Parts 1–7 and the Definitions in the 2021–2024 edition. No changes are contemplated before 2029, but any changes determined to be urgent before then will be announced through national authorities and posted on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Appendices  When the rules of an appendix apply, they take precedence over any conflicting rules in Parts 1–7 and the Definitions. Each appendix in this book is identified by a letter. Other appendices are available on the World Sailing website and are identified by two or three letters. A reference to a rule in an appendix will contain the letter or letters, and the rule number (for example, ‘rule A1’ or ‘rule MR1’). The letters I, K, L, O and Q are not used to designate appendices in this book. \\n\\n Development Rules  Development Rules may be approved by World Sailing for specific events or categories of events. They are available on the World Sailing website and are identified by the letters DR. \\n\\n Notice of Race and Sailing Instructions  Guides and templates for writing a notice of race and sailing instructions are available, in various file formats, on the World Sailing website at\\n www.sailing.org/racingrules. National authorities are encouraged to translate these guides and templates. \\n\\n World Sailing Regulations  The Regulations are referred to in the definition Rule and in rule 6, but they are not included in this book because they can be changed at any time. The most recent versions of the Regulations are published on the World Sailing website; new versions will be announced through national authorities.\\n\\n\\n###### 6\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Interpretations  World Sailing publishes the following authoritative interpretations of the racing rules:\\n\\n • The Case Book – Interpretations of the Racing Rules,\\n\\n • The Call Books, for various disciplines,\\n\\n • Interpretations of Rule 42, Propulsion, and\\n\\n • Interpretations of the Regulations, for those Regulations that\\n are rules.\\n These publications are available on the World Sailing website. Other interpretations of the racing rules are not authoritative unless approved by World Sailing. \\n\\n 7\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n### DEFINITIONS\\n\\n###### A term used as stated below is shown in italic type or, in preambles, in bold italic type. The meaning of several other terms is given in Terminology in the Introduction.\\n\\n Abandon  A race that a race committee or protest committee abandons is void but may be resailed.\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One boat is clear astern of another when her hull and equipment in normal position are behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other boat’s hull and equipment in normal position. The other boat is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a boat between them overlaps both. These terms always apply to boats on the same tack. They apply to boats on opposite tacks only when rule 18 applies between them or when both boats are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Committee  The protest committee, the race committee or the technical committee.\\n\\n Conflict of Interest  A conflict of interest exists if a person \\n\\n (a) may gain or lose as a result of a decision to which that person contributes,\\n\\n (b) may reasonably appear to have a personal or financial interest which could affect that person’s ability to be impartial, or\\n\\n (c) has a close personal interest in a decision. \\n\\n Continuing Obstruction  An obstruction is a continuing obstruction when the boat with the shortest hull referred to in the rule using the term will pass alongside it for at least three of her hull lengths. However, the following are not a continuing obstruction: a vessel under way, a boat racing, or a race committee vessel that is also a mark. \\n\\n Fetching  A boat is fetching a mark when she is in a position to pass to windward of it and leave it on the required side without changing tack.\\n\\n Finish A boat finishes when, after her starting signal, any part of her hull crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n 8\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or\\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course.\\n\\n After finishing she need not cross the finishing line completely. The sailing instructions may change the direction in which boats are required to cross the finishing line to finish. \\n\\n Keep Clear A boat keeps clear of a right-of-way boat\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way boat can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and,\\n\\n (b) when the boats are overlapped, if the right-of-way boat can also change course in both directions without immediately making contact.\\n\\n Leeward and Windward A boat’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her mainsail lies. The other side is her windward side. When two boats on the same tack overlap, the one on the leeward side of the other is the leeward boat. The other is the windward boat.\\n\\n Mark An object the sailing instructions require a boat to leave on a specified side, a race committee vessel surrounded by navigable water from which the starting or finishing line extends, and an object intentionally attached to the object or vessel. However, an anchor line is not part of the mark.\\n\\n Mark-Room  Room for a boat\\n\\n (a) to sail to the mark when her proper course is to sail close to it,\\n\\n (b) to round or pass the mark on the required side, and\\n\\n (c) to leave it astern.\\n\\n Obstruction  An obstruction is \\n\\n (a) an object that a boat could not pass without changing course substantially, if she were sailing directly towards it and one of her hull lengths from it;\\n\\n (b) an object that is so designated in a rule;\\n\\n (c) an object that can be safely passed on only one side; or\\n\\n (d) an area or line in a rule that boats are prohibited from entering or crossing. \\n\\n 9\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### However, a boat racing is not an obstruction to other boats unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. \\n\\n Overlap See Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap.\\n\\n Party A party to a hearing is\\n\\n (a) for a protest hearing: a protestor, a protestee;\\n\\n (b) for a redress hearing: a boat requesting redress or for which redress is requested; a boat for which a hearing is called to consider redress under rule 61.1; a committee acting under rule 61.1;\\n\\n (c) for a redress hearing under rule 61.4(b)(1): the body alleged to have made an improper action or omission;\\n\\n (d) a person against whom an allegation of a breach of rule 69.1(a) is made; a person presenting an allegation under rule 69.2(e)(1);\\n\\n (e) a support person subject to a hearing under rule 62 or 69; any boat that person supports; a person appointed to present an allegation under rule 62.2.\\n\\n However, the protest committee is never a party.\\n\\n Postpone A postponed race is delayed before its scheduled start but may be started or abandoned later.\\n\\n Proper Course A course a boat would choose in order to complete the leg she believes she is on as soon as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to in the rule using the term. A boat has no proper course before her starting signal.\\n\\n Protest An allegation made under rule 60 by a boat or a committee that a boat has broken a rule.\\n\\n Racing  A boat is racing from her preparatory signal until she finishes and clears the finishing line and marks or retires, or until the race committee signals a general recall, postponement or abandonment.\\n\\n Room The space a boat needs in the existing conditions, including space to comply with her obligations under the rules of Part 2 and rule 31, while manoeuvring promptly in a seamanlike way.\\n\\n 10\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Rule\\n\\n (a) The rules in this book, including the Definitions, Race Signals, Introduction, preambles and the rules of relevant appendices, but not the Basic Principles or titles;\\n\\n (b) World Sailing Regulations that have been designated by World Sailing as having the status of a rule and are published on the World Sailing website;\\n\\n (c) the prescriptions of the national authority, unless they are changed by the notice of race or sailing instructions in compliance with the national authority’s prescription, if any, to rule 88.2;\\n\\n (d) the class rules (for a boat racing under a handicap or rating system, the rules of that system are ‘class rules’);\\n\\n (e) the notice of race;\\n\\n (f) the sailing instructions; and\\n\\n (g) any other documents that govern the event.\\n\\n Sail the Course A boat sails the course when\\n\\n (a) she starts;\\n\\n (b) a string representing her track until she finishes, when drawn taut,\\n\\n (1) passes each mark of the course for the race on the required side and in the correct order (including the starting marks),\\n\\n (2) touches each mark designated in the sailing instructions to be a rounding mark, and\\n\\n (3) passes between the marks of a gate from the direction of the course from the previous mark; and then\\n\\n (c) she finishes.\\n\\n A mark that does not begin, bound or end the leg the boat is sailing does not have a required side. \\n\\n Start  A boat starts when, her hull having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, and having complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, any part of her hull crosses the starting line from the pre-start side to the course side.\\n\\n Support Person Any person who\\n\\n (a) provides, or may provide, physical or advisory support to a competitor, including any coach, trainer, manager, team staff, medic, paramedic or\\n 11\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### any other person working with, treating or assisting a competitor in or preparing for the competition, or\\n\\n (b) is the parent or guardian of a competitor.\\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port A boat is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to her windward side.\\n\\n Windward See Leeward and Windward.\\n\\n Zone The area around a mark within a distance of three hull lengths of the boat nearer to it. A boat is in the zone when any part of her hull is in the zone.\\n\\n 12\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n### BASIC PRINCIPLES\\n\\n###### The Basic Principles shall not be changed.\\n SPORTSMANSHIP AND THE RULES\\n\\n Competitors in the sport of sailing are governed by a body of rules that they are expected to follow and enforce. A fundamental principle of sportsmanship is that when a boat breaks a rule and is not exonerated, she will promptly take an appropriate penalty or action, which may be to retire.\\n ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\n Participants are encouraged to minimize any adverse environmental impact of the sport of sailing.\\n\\n#### PART 1\\n\\n### FUNDAMENTAL RULES\\n\\n###### 1 SAFETY\\n\\n 1.1 Helping Those in Danger\\n\\n A boat, competitor or support person shall give all possible help to any person or vessel in danger.\\n\\n 1.2 Life-Saving Equipment and Personal Flotation Devices\\n\\n A boat shall carry adequate life-saving equipment for all persons on board, including one item ready for immediate use, unless her class rules make some other provision. Each competitor is individually responsible for wearing a personal flotation device adequate for the conditions.\\n\\n 2 FAIR SAILING\\n\\n A boat and her owner shall compete in compliance with recognized principles of sportsmanship and fair play. A boat may be penalized under this rule only if it is clearly established that these principles\\n\\n 13\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### have been violated. The penalty shall be a disqualification that is not excludable.\\n\\n 3 DECISION TO RACE\\n\\n The responsibility for a boat’s decision to participate in a race or to continue racing is hers alone.\\n\\n 4 ACCEPTANCE OF THE RULES\\n\\n 4.1 (a) By participating or intending to participate in an event conducted under the rules, each competitor and boat owner agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n (b) A support person by providing support, or a parent or guardian by permitting their child to enter an event, agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n 4.2 Each competitor and boat owner agrees, on behalf of their support persons, that such support persons are bound by the rules.\\n\\n 4.3 Acceptance of the rules includes agreement\\n\\n (a) to be governed by the rules;\\n\\n (b) to accept the penalties imposed and other action taken under the rules, subject to the appeal and review procedures provided in them, as the final determination of any matter arising under the rules;\\n\\n (c) with respect to any such determination, not to resort to any court of law or tribunal not provided for in the rules; and\\n\\n (d) by each competitor and boat owner to ensure that their support persons are aware of the rules.\\n\\n 4.4 The person in charge of each boat shall ensure that all competitors in the crew and the boat’s owner are aware of their responsibilities under this rule.\\n\\n 4.5 This rule may be changed by a prescription of the national authority of the venue.\\n\\n 5 RULES GOVERNING ORGANIZING AUTHORITIES  AND OFFICIALS\\n\\n 14\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### The organizing authority, a committee and other race officials shall be governed by the rules in the conduct and judging of the event.\\n\\n 6 WORLD SAILING REGULATIONS \\n\\n 6.1 Each competitor, boat owner and support person shall comply with the World Sailing Regulations that have been designated by World Sailing as having the status of a rule. These regulations as of 30 June 2024 are the World Sailing:\\n\\n ● Advertising Code\\n\\n ● Anti-Doping Code\\n\\n ● Code of Ethics \\n\\n ● Eligibility Code\\n\\n ● Sailor Categorization Code\\n\\n 6.2 The rules of Part 5 do not apply unless protests are permitted in the Regulation alleged to have been broken. \\n\\n 15\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### PART 2\\n\\n### WHEN BOATS MEET\\n\\n###### The rules of Part 2 apply between boats that are sailing in or near the racing area and intend to race, are racing, or have been racing. However, a boat not racing shall not be penalized for breaking one of these rules, except rule 14 when the incident resulted in injury or serious damage, or rule 23.1.\\n\\n When a boat sailing under these rules meets a vessel that is not, she shall comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS) or government right-of-way rules. If the notice of race so states, the rules of Part 2 are replaced by the right- of-way rules of the IRPCAS or by government right-of-way rules.\\n\\n SECTION A\\n#### RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n###### A boat has right of way over another boat when the other boat is required to keep clear of her. However, some rules in Sections B, C and D limit the actions of a right-of-way boat.\\n\\n 10 ON OPPOSITE TACKS\\n\\n When boats are on opposite tacks, a port-tack boat shall keep clear of a starboard-tack boat.\\n\\n 11 ON THE SAME TACK, OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and overlapped, a windward boat shall keep clear of a leeward boat.\\n\\n 12 ON THE SAME TACK, NOT OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and not overlapped, a boat clear astern shall keep clear of a boat clear ahead.\\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n After a boat passes head to wind, she shall keep clear of other boats until she is on a close-hauled course. During that time rules 10, 11 and 12 do not apply. If two boats are subject to this rule at the same\\n\\n 16\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### time, the one on the other’s port side or the one astern shall keep clear.\\n\\n SECTION B\\n#### GENERAL LIMITATIONS\\n\\n###### 14 AVOIDING CONTACT\\n\\n If reasonably possible, a boat shall\\n\\n (a) avoid contact with another boat,\\n\\n (b) not cause contact between boats, and\\n\\n (c) not cause contact between a boat and an object that should be avoided.\\n\\n However, a right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark-room to which she is entitled, need not act to avoid contact until it is clear that the other boat is not keeping clear or giving room or mark-room. \\n\\n 15 ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n When a boat acquires right of way, she shall initially give the other boat room to keep clear, unless she acquires right of way because of the other boat’s actions.\\n\\n 16 CHANGING COURSE\\n\\n 16.1 When a right-of-way boat changes course, she shall give the other boat room to keep clear.\\n\\n 16.2 In addition, on a beat to windward when a port-tack boat is keeping clear by sailing to pass to leeward of a starboard-tack boat, the starboard-tack boat shall not bear away if as a result the port-tack boat must change course immediately to continue keeping clear.\\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK; PROPER COURSE\\n\\n If a boat clear astern becomes overlapped within two of her hull lengths to leeward of a boat on the same tack, she shall not sail above her proper course while they remain on the same tack and overlapped within that distance, unless in doing so she promptly sails astern of the other boat.\\n\\n 17\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### SECTION C\\n#### AT MARKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n###### Section C rules do not apply between boats when the mark or obstruction referred to in those rules is a starting mark surrounded by navigable water or its anchor line, from the time the boats are approaching it to start until they have left it astern. \\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n 18.1 When Rule 18 Applies\\n\\n (a) Rule 18 applies between boats when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is in the zone. However, it does not apply\\n\\n (1) between boats on opposite tacks on a beat to windward,\\n\\n (2) between boats on opposite tacks when the proper course at the mark for one but not both of them is to tack,\\n\\n (3) between a boat approaching a mark and one leaving it, or\\n\\n (4) if the mark is a continuing obstruction, in which case rule 19 applies. \\n\\n (b) Rule 18 no longer applies between boats when mark-room has been given. \\n\\n 18.2 Giving Mark-Room \\n\\n (a) When the first of two boats reaches the zone,\\n\\n (1) if the boats are overlapped, the outside boat at that moment shall give the inside boat mark-room;\\n\\n (2) if the boats are not overlapped, the boat that has not reached the zone at that moment shall give the other boat mark-room.\\n\\n When a boat is required to give mark-room by this rule, she shall continue to do so for as long as this rule applies, even if later an overlap is broken or a new overlap begins. \\n\\n (b) Rule 18.2(a) no longer applies if the boat entitled to mark-room passes head to wind or leaves the zone. \\n\\n 18\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (c) When rule 18.2(a) does not apply and the boats are overlapped, the outside boat shall give the inside boat mark-room. \\n\\n (d) If a boat obtained an inside overlap from clear astern or by tacking to windward of the other boat and, from the time the overlap began, the outside boat has been unable to give mark- room, rules 18.2(a) and 18.2(c) do not apply between them. \\n\\n (e) If there is reasonable doubt that a boat obtained or broke an overlap in time, it shall be presumed that she did not. \\n\\n 18.3 Tacking in the Zone\\n\\n If a boat passes head to wind from port to starboard tack in the zone of a mark to be left to port, rule 18.2 does not apply between her and another boat on starboard tack that is fetching the mark. If the other boat has been on starboard tack since entering the zone, the boat that passed head to wind\\n\\n (a) shall not cause the other boat to sail above close-hauled to avoid contact, and\\n\\n (b) shall give mark-room if the other boat becomes overlapped inside her. \\n\\n 18.4 Gybing in the Zone\\n\\n When an inside overlapped right-of-way boat must gybe at a mark to sail her proper course, until she gybes she shall sail no farther from the mark than needed to sail that course. Rule 18.4 does not apply at a gate mark.\\n\\n 19 ROOM TO PASS AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n 19.1 When Rule 19 Applies\\n\\n Rule 19 applies between two boats at an obstruction except when rule 18 applies between them and\\n\\n (a) the obstruction is the mark, or\\n\\n (b) the obstruction is another boat overlapped with each of them. \\n\\n However, at a continuing obstruction, rule 19 always applies and rule 18 does not. \\n\\n 19.2 Giving Room at an Obstruction\\n\\n (a) A right-of-way boat may choose to pass an obstruction on her port or starboard side. If a right-of-way boat changes course\\n 19\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### when choosing on which side to pass the obstruction, she shall give the other boat room to keep clear. \\n\\n (b) When the boats are overlapped, the outside boat shall give the inside boat room between her and the obstruction, unless she has been unable to do so from the time the overlap began. \\n\\n (c) While boats are passing a continuing obstruction, if a boat that was clear astern and required to keep clear becomes overlapped between the other boat and the obstruction and, at the moment the overlap begins, there is not room for her to pass between them,\\n\\n (1) she is not entitled to room under rule 19.2(b), and\\n\\n (2) while the boats remain overlapped, she shall keep clear and rules 10 and 11 do not apply.\\n\\n 20 ROOM TO TACK AT AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n 20.1 Hailing\\n\\n A boat may hail for room to tack and avoid a boat on the same tack by hailing ‘Room to tack’. However, she shall not hail unless\\n\\n (a) she is approaching an obstruction and will soon need to make a substantial course change to avoid it safely, and\\n\\n (b) she is sailing close-hauled or above.\\n\\n In addition, she shall not hail if the obstruction is a mark and a boat that is fetching it would be required to change course as a result of the hail.\\n\\n 20.2 Responding\\n\\n (a) After a boat hails, she shall give a hailed boat time to respond.\\n\\n (b) A hailed boat shall respond even if the hail breaks rule 20.1.\\n\\n (c) A hailed boat shall respond either by tacking as soon as possible, or by immediately replying ‘You tack’ and then giving the hailing boat room to tack and avoid her.\\n\\n (d) When a hailed boat responds, the hailing boat shall tack as soon as possible.\\n\\n (e) From the time a boat hails until she has tacked and avoided a hailed boat, rule 18.2 does not apply between them.\\n\\n 20\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 20.3 Passing On a Hail to an Additional Boat\\n\\n When a boat has been hailed for room to tack and she intends to respond by tacking, she may hail another boat on the same tack for room to tack and avoid her. She may hail even if her hail does not meet the conditions of rule 20.1. Rule 20.2 applies between her and a boat she hails.\\n\\n 20.4 Additional Requirements for Hails\\n\\n (a) When conditions are such that a hail may not be heard, the boat shall also make a signal that clearly indicates her need for room to tack or her response.\\n\\n (b) The notice of race may specify an alternative communication for a boat to indicate her need for room to tack or her response, and require boats to use it.\\n\\n SECTION D\\n#### OTHER RULES\\n\\n###### When rule 21 or 22 applies between two boats, Section A rules do not.\\n\\n 21 STARTING ERRORS; TAKING PENALTIES;  BACKING A SAIL\\n 21.1 A boat sailing towards the pre-start side of the starting line or one of its extensions after her starting signal to start or to comply with rule 30.1 shall keep clear of a boat not doing so until her hull is completely on the pre-start side.\\n\\n 21.2 A boat taking a penalty shall keep clear of one that is not.\\n 21.3 A boat moving astern, or sideways to windward, through the water by backing a sail shall keep clear of one that is not.\\n\\n 22 CAPSIZED, ANCHORED OR AGROUND; RESCUING\\n\\n If possible, a boat shall avoid a boat that is capsized or has not regained control after capsizing, is anchored or aground, or is trying to help a person or vessel in danger. A boat is capsized when her masthead is in the water.\\n\\n 21\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 23 INTERFERING WITH ANOTHER BOAT\\n 23.1 If reasonably possible, a boat not racing shall not interfere with a boat that is racing.\\n\\n 23.2 If reasonably possible, a boat shall not interfere with a boat that is taking a penalty, sailing on another leg or subject to rule 21.1. However, after the starting signal this rule does not apply when the boat is sailing her proper course.\\n\\n 22\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### PART 3\\n\\n### CONDUCT OF A RACE\\n\\n###### 25 NOTICE OF RACE, SAILING INSTRUCTIONS  AND SIGNALS\\n 25.1 The notice of race shall be made available to each boat that enters an event before she enters. The sailing instructions shall be made available to each boat before a race begins.\\n\\n 25.2 The meanings of the visual and sound signals stated in Race Signals shall not be changed except under rule 86.1(b). The meanings of any other signals that may be used shall be stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions.\\n\\n 25.3 When the race committee is required to display a flag as a visual signal, it may use a flag or other object of a similar appearance.\\n\\n 26 STARTING RACES\\n\\n Races shall be started by using the following signals. Times shall be taken from the visual signals; the absence of a sound signal shall be disregarded.\\n\\n\\n###### Minutes before\\n starting signal\\n\\n\\n###### Visual signal Sound signal\\n\\n\\n###### Means\\n\\n\\n######  5* Class flag One Warning signal\\n\\n\\n###### 4 P, I, Z, Z with I, U, or black flag \\n 1 Preparatory flag removed\\n\\n 0 Class flag removed\\n\\n\\n###### One Preparatory signal\\n\\n One long One minute\\n\\n One Starting signal\\n\\n\\n###### *or as stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions\\n\\n The warning signal for each succeeding class shall be made with or after the starting signal of the preceding class.\\n\\n 27 OTHER RACE COMMITTEE ACTIONS BEFORE  THE STARTING SIGNAL\\n 27.1 No later than the warning signal, the race committee shall signal or otherwise designate the course to be sailed if the sailing instructions\\n 23\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### have not stated the course, and it may replace one course signal with another and signal that wearing personal flotation devices is required (display flag Y with one sound).\\n\\n 27.2 No later than the preparatory signal, the race committee may move a starting mark.\\n\\n 27.3 Before the starting signal, the race committee may for any reason postpone (display flag AP, AP over H, or AP over A, with two sounds) or abandon the race (display flag N over H, or N over A, with three sounds).\\n\\n 28 SAILING THE COURSE \\n 28.1 A boat shall sail the course.\\n\\n 28.2 A boat may correct any errors in sailing the course, provided she has not finished.\\n\\n 29 RECALLS\\n\\n 29.1 Individual Recall\\n\\n When at a boat’s starting signal any part of her hull is on the course side of the starting line or she must comply with rule 30.1, the race committee shall promptly display flag X with one sound. The flag shall be displayed until the hull of each such boat has been completely on the pre-start side of the starting line or one of its extensions, and until all such boats have complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, but no later than four minutes after the starting signal or one minute before any later starting signal, whichever is earlier. If rule 29.2, 30.3 or 30.4 applies this rule does not.\\n\\n 29.2 General Recall\\n\\n When at the starting signal the race committee is unable to identify boats that are on the course side of the starting line or to which rule 30 applies, or there has been an error in the starting procedure, the race committee may signal a general recall (display the First Substitute with two sounds). The warning signal for a new start for the recalled class shall be made one minute after the First Substitute is removed (one sound), and the starts for any succeeding classes shall follow the new start.\\n\\n 24\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 30 STARTING PENALTIES\\n\\n 30.1 I Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag I has been displayed, and any part of a boat’s hull is on the course side of the starting line or one of its extensions during the last minute before her starting signal, she shall sail across an extension so that her hull is completely on the pre-start side before she starts.\\n\\n 30.2 Z Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag Z has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall receive, without a hearing, a 20% Scoring Penalty calculated as stated in rule 44.3(c). She shall be penalized even if the race is restarted or resailed, but not if it is postponed or abandoned before the starting signal. If she is similarly identified during a subsequent attempt to start the same race, she shall receive an additional 20% Scoring Penalty.\\n\\n 30.3 U Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag U has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall be disqualified without a hearing, but not if the race is restarted or resailed.\\n\\n 30.4 Black Flag Rule\\n If a black flag has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall be disqualified without a hearing, even if the race is restarted or resailed, but not if it is postponed or abandoned before the starting signal. If a general recall is signalled or the race is abandoned after the starting signal, the race committee shall display her sail number before the next warning signal for that race, and if the race is restarted or resailed she shall not sail in it. If she does so, her disqualification shall not be excluded in calculating her series score.\\n\\n 25\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 31 TOUCHING A MARK\\n\\n While racing, a boat shall not touch a starting mark before starting, a mark that begins, bounds or ends the leg of the course on which she is sailing, or a finishing mark after finishing.\\n\\n 32 SHORTENING OR ABANDONING AFTER THE START\\n 32.1 After the starting signal, the race committee may shorten the course or abandon the race: \\n\\n (a) because of foul weather,\\n\\n (b) because of insufficient wind making it unlikely that any boat will sail the course within the race time limit, \\n\\n (c) because a mark is missing or out of position, or\\n\\n (d) for any other reason directly affecting the safety or fairness of the competition.\\n\\n In addition, the race committee may shorten the course so that other scheduled races can be sailed, or abandon the race because of an error in the starting procedure. However, after one boat has sailed the course within the race time limit, if any, the race committee shall not abandon the race without considering the consequences for all boats in the race or series. \\n\\n 32.2 To shorten the course, the race committee shall display flag S with two sounds before the first boat crosses the finishing line. If the course is shortened, the finishing line shall be,\\n\\n (a) at a rounding mark, between the mark and a staff displaying flag S;\\n\\n (b) a line the course requires boats to cross; or\\n\\n (c) at a gate, between the gate marks.\\n\\n 32.3 To abandon the race, the race committee shall display flag N, N over H, or N over A, with three sounds. \\n\\n 33 CHANGING THE NEXT LEG OF THE COURSE\\n\\n While boats are racing, the race committee may change a leg of the course that begins at a rounding mark or at a gate by changing the position of the next mark (or the finishing line) and signalling all boats before they begin the leg. The next mark need not be in position at that time.\\n\\n 26\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (a) If the direction of the leg will be changed, the signal shall be the display of flag C with repetitive sounds and one or both of\\n\\n (1) the new compass bearing,\\n (2) a green triangle for a change to starboard or a red rectangle for a change to port.\\n (b) If the length of the leg will be changed, the signal shall be the display of flag C with repetitive sounds and a ‘–’ if the length will be decreased or a ‘+’ if it will be increased.\\n (c) Subsequent legs may be changed without further signalling to maintain the course shape.\\n\\n 34 MARK MISSING If a mark is missing or out of position while boats are racing, the race committee shall, if possible, (a) move it to its correct position or replace it with a new one of similar appearance, or\\n (b) replace it with an object displaying flag M and make repetitive sounds. \\n\\n 35 RACE TIME LIMIT AND SCORES If one boat sails the course within the time limit for that race, if any, all boats that finish shall be scored according to their finishing places unless the race is abandoned. If no boat sails the course within the race time limit, the race committee shall abandon the race. \\n\\n 36 RACES RESTARTED OR RESAILED If a race is restarted or resailed, a breach of a rule in the original race, or in any previous restart or resail of that race, shall not (a) prohibit a boat from competing unless she has broken rule 30.4; or\\n (b) cause a boat to be penalized except under rule 2, 30.2, 30.4 or 69 or under rule 14 when she has caused injury or serious damage.\\n\\n 37 SEARCH AND RESCUE INSTRUCTIONS When the race committee displays flag V with one sound, all boats and official and support vessels shall, if possible, monitor the race committee communication channel for search and rescue\\n instructions.\\n 27\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### PART 4\\n\\n### OTHER REQUIREMENTS WHEN RACING\\n\\n###### Part 4 rules apply only to boats racing unless the rule states otherwise.\\n\\n SECTION A\\n#### GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\\n\\n###### 40 PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES\\n\\n 40.1 Basic Rule\\n\\n When rule 40.1 is made applicable by rule 40.2, each competitor shall wear a personal flotation device except briefly while changing or adjusting clothing or personal equipment. Wet suits and dry suits are not personal flotation devices.\\n\\n 40.2 When Rule 40.1 Applies\\n\\n Rule 40.1 applies if\\n\\n (a) flag Y was displayed afloat with one sound before or with the warning signal, while racing in that race;\\n\\n (b) flag Y was displayed ashore with one sound, at all times while afloat that day; or\\n\\n (c) a rule in the class rules, notice of race or sailing instructions states that it applies.\\n\\n 41 OUTSIDE HELP\\n\\n A boat shall not receive help from any outside source, except\\n\\n (a) help for a crew member who is ill, injured or in danger;\\n\\n (b) after a collision, help from the crew of the other vessel to get clear;\\n\\n (c) help in the form of information freely available to all boats;\\n\\n (d) unsolicited information from a disinterested source, which may be another boat in the same race.\\n\\n 28\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 42 PROPULSION\\n\\n 42.1 Basic Rule\\n\\n Except when permitted in rule 42.3 or 45, a boat shall compete by using only the wind and water to increase, maintain or decrease her speed. Her crew may adjust the trim of sails and hull, and perform other acts of seamanship, but shall not otherwise move their bodies to propel the boat.\\n\\n 42.2 Prohibited Actions\\n\\n Without limiting the application of rule 42.1, these actions are prohibited:\\n\\n (a) pumping: repeated fanning of any sail either by pulling in and releasing the sail or by vertical or athwartship body movement;\\n\\n (b) rocking: repeated rolling of the boat, induced by\\n\\n (1) body movement,\\n\\n (2) repeated adjustment of the sails or centreboard, or\\n\\n (3) steering;\\n\\n (c) ooching: sudden forward body movement, stopped abruptly;\\n\\n (d) sculling: repeated movement of the helm that is either forceful or that propels the boat forward or prevents her from moving astern;\\n\\n (e) repeated tacks or gybes unrelated to changes in the wind or to tactical considerations.\\n\\n 42.3 Exceptions\\n\\n (a) A boat may be rolled to facilitate steering.\\n\\n (b) A boat’s crew may move their bodies to exaggerate the rolling that facilitates steering the boat through a tack or a gybe, provided that, just after the tack or gybe is completed, the boat’s speed is not greater than it would have been in the absence of the tack or gybe.\\n\\n (c) When surfing (rapidly accelerating down the front of a wave), planing or foiling is possible,\\n\\n (1) to initiate surfing or planing, each sail may be pulled in only once for each wave or gust of wind, or\\n\\n 29\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (2) to initiate foiling, each sail may be pulled in any number of times.\\n\\n (d) When a boat is above a close-hauled course and either stationary or moving slowly, she may scull to turn to a close- hauled course.\\n\\n (e) If a batten is inverted, the boat’s crew may pump the sail until the batten is no longer inverted. This action is not permitted if it clearly propels the boat.\\n\\n (f) A boat may reduce speed by repeatedly moving her helm.\\n\\n (g) Any means of propulsion may be used to help a person or another vessel in danger.\\n\\n (h) To get clear after grounding or colliding with a vessel or object, a boat may use force applied by her crew or the crew of the other vessel and any equipment other than a propulsion engine. However, the use of an engine may be permitted by rule 42.3(i).\\n\\n (i) Sailing instructions may, in stated circumstances, permit propulsion using an engine or any other method, provided the boat does not gain a significant advantage in the race.\\n\\n Note: Interpretations of rule 42 are available on the World Sailing website or by mail upon request.\\n\\n 43 EXONERATION\\n\\n 43.1 (a) When as a consequence of breaking a rule a boat has compelled another boat to break a rule, the other boat is exonerated for her breach.\\n\\n (b) When a boat is sailing within the room or mark-room to which she is entitled and, as a consequence of an incident with a boat required to give her that room or mark-room, she breaks a rule of Section A of Part 2, rule 15, 16, or 31, she is exonerated for her breach.\\n\\n (c) A right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark- room to which she is entitled, is exonerated for breaking rule 14 if the contact does not cause damage or injury.\\n\\n 43.2 A boat exonerated for breaking a rule need not take a penalty and shall not be penalized for breaking that rule.\\n\\n 30\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 44 PENALTIES AT THE TIME OF AN INCIDENT\\n\\n 44.1 Taking a Penalty\\n\\n A boat may take a Two-Turns Penalty when she may have broken one or more rules of Part 2 in an incident while racing. She may take a One-Turn Penalty when she may have broken rule 31. Alternatively, the notice of race or sailing instructions may specify the use of the Scoring Penalty or some other penalty, in which case the specified penalty shall replace the One-Turn and the Two-Turns Penalty. However,\\n\\n (a) when a boat may have broken a rule of Part 2 and rule 31 in the same incident she need not take the penalty for breaking rule 31;\\n\\n (b) if the boat caused injury or serious damage or, despite taking a penalty, gained a significant advantage in the race or series by her breach her penalty shall be to retire.\\n\\n 44.2 One-Turn and Two-Turns Penalties\\n\\n After getting well clear of other boats as soon after the incident as possible, a boat takes a One-Turn or Two-Turns Penalty by promptly making the required number of turns in the same direction, each turn including one tack and one gybe. When a boat takes the penalty at or near the finishing line, her hull shall be completely on the course side of the line before she finishes.\\n\\n 44.3 Scoring Penalty\\n\\n (a) If specified in the notice of race or sailing instructions, a boat takes a Scoring Penalty by displaying a yellow flag at the first reasonable opportunity after the incident. \\n\\n (b) When a boat has taken a Scoring Penalty, she shall keep the yellow flag displayed until finishing and call the race committee’s attention to it at the finishing line. At that time she shall also inform the race committee of the identity of the other boat involved in the incident. If this is impracticable, she shall do so at the first reasonable opportunity and within the protest time limit.\\n\\n (c) The race score for a boat that takes a Scoring Penalty shall be the score she would have received without that penalty, made worse by the number of points stated in the notice of race or\\n 31\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### sailing instructions. When the number of points is not stated, the penalty shall be 20% of the score for Did Not Finish, rounded to the nearest tenth of a point (0.05 rounded upward). The scores of other boats shall not be changed; therefore, two boats may receive the same score. However, the penalty shall not cause the boat’s score to be worse than the score for Did Not Finish. \\n\\n 45 HAULING OUT; MAKING FAST; ANCHORING\\n\\n A boat shall be afloat and off moorings at her preparatory signal. Thereafter, she shall not be hauled out or made fast except to bail out, reef sails or make repairs. She may anchor or the crew may stand on the bottom. She shall recover the anchor before continuing in the race unless she is unable to do so.\\n\\n 46 PERSON IN CHARGE\\n\\n A boat shall have on board a person in charge designated by the member or organization that entered the boat. See rule 75.\\n\\n 47 TRASH DISPOSAL\\n\\n Competitors and support persons shall not intentionally put trash in the water. This rule applies at all times while afloat. The penalty for a breach of this rule may be less than disqualification.\\n\\n SECTION B\\n#### EQUIPMENT-RELATED REQUIREMENTS\\n\\n###### 48 L IMITATIONS ON EQUIPMENT AND CREW\\n 48.1 A boat shall use only the equipment on board at her preparatory signal.\\n\\n 48.2 No person on board shall intentionally leave, except when ill or injured, or to help a person or vessel in danger, or to swim. A person leaving the boat by accident or to swim shall be back in contact with the boat before the crew resumes sailing the boat to the next mark.\\n\\n 32\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 49 CREW POSITION; LIFELINES\\n 49.1 Competitors shall use no device designed to position their bodies outboard, other than hiking straps and stiffeners worn under the thighs.\\n\\n 49.2 When lifelines are required by the class rules or any other rule, competitors shall not position any part of their torsos outside them, except briefly to perform a necessary task. However, on boats equipped with upper and lower lifelines, competitors sitting facing outboard with their waist inside the lower lifeline may have the upper part of their body outside the upper lifeline. Unless a class rule or any other rule specifies a maximum deflection, lifelines shall be taut. If the class rules do not specify the material or minimum diameter of lifelines, they shall comply with the corresponding specifications in the World Sailing Offshore Special Regulations. \\n\\n Note: Those regulations are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n 50 COMPETITOR CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT\\n 50.1 (a) Competitors shall not wear or carry clothing or equipment for the purpose of increasing their weight.\\n\\n (b) Furthermore, a competitor’s clothing and equipment shall not weigh more than 8 kilograms, excluding a crew harness (as defined in The Equipment Rules of Sailing) and clothing (including footwear) worn only below the knee. Class rules or the notice of race may specify a lower weight or a higher weight up to 10 kilograms. Class rules may include footwear and other clothing worn below the knee within that weight. A crew harness shall have positive buoyancy in fresh water and shall not weigh more than 2 kilograms, except that class rules may specify a higher weight up to 4 kilograms. Weights shall be determined as required by Appendix H.\\n\\n (c) A crew harness shall allow the competitor, at any time, to easily disconnect the harness from the trapeze or attachment to the boat.\\n\\n 50.2 Rules 50.1(b) and 50.1(c) do not apply to boats required to be equipped with lifelines.\\n\\n 33\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 51 MOVABLE BALLAST\\n\\n All movable ballast, including sails that are not set, shall be properly stowed. Water, dead weight or ballast shall not be moved for the purpose of changing trim or stability. Floorboards, bulkheads, doors, stairs and water tanks shall be left in place and all cabin fixtures kept on board. However, bilge water may be bailed out.\\n\\n 52 MANUAL POWER A boat’s standing rigging, running rigging, spars and movable hull appendages shall be adjusted and operated only by the power provided by the crew.\\n\\n 53 SKIN FRICTION\\n\\n A boat shall not eject or release a substance, such as a polymer, or have specially textured surfaces that could improve the character of the flow of water inside the boundary layer.\\n\\n 54 FORESTAYS AND HEADSAIL TACKS\\n\\n Forestays and headsail tacks, except those of spinnaker staysails when the boat is not close-hauled, shall be attached approximately on a boat’s centreline.\\n\\n 55 SETTING AND SHEETING SAILS\\n\\n 55.1 Changing Sails\\n\\n When headsails or spinnakers are being changed, a replacing sail may be fully set and trimmed before the replaced sail is lowered. However, only one mainsail and, except when changing, only one spinnaker shall be carried set at a time.\\n\\n 55.2 Spinnaker Poles; Whisker Poles\\n\\n Only one spinnaker pole or whisker pole shall be used at a time except when gybing. When in use, it shall be attached to the foremost mast spar (as defined in The Equipment Rules of Sailing).\\n\\n 34\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 55.3 Sheeting Sails\\n\\n No sail shall be sheeted over or through any device that exerts outward pressure on a sheet or clew of a sail at a point from which, with the boat upright, a vertical line would fall outside the hull or deck, except:\\n\\n (a) a headsail clew may be connected (as defined in The Equipment Rules of Sailing) to a whisker pole, provided that a spinnaker is not set;\\n\\n (b) any sail may be sheeted to or led above a boom that is regularly used for a sail and is permanently attached to the mast from which the head of the sail is set;\\n\\n (c) a headsail may be sheeted to its own boom that requires no adjustment when tacking; and\\n\\n (d) the boom of a sail may be sheeted to a bumkin.\\n\\n 55.4 Headsails and Spinnakers\\n\\n For the purposes of rules 54 and 55 and Appendix G, the definitions of ‘headsail’ and ‘spinnaker’ in The Equipment Rules of Sailing shall be used.\\n\\n Note: The Equipment Rules of Sailing are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n 56 FOG SIGNALS AND LIGHTS; TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEMES; TRACKING SYSTEMS \\n\\n 56.1 When so equipped, a boat shall sound fog signals and show lights as required by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS) or applicable government rules.\\n\\n 56.2 A boat shall comply with rule 10, Traffic Separation Schemes, of the IRPCAS.\\n\\n Note: Appendix TS, Traffic Separation Schemes, is available on the World Sailing website. The notice of race may change rule 56.2 by stating that Section A, Section B or Section C of Appendix TS applies.\\n\\n 56.3 When a rule requires a boat to be equipped with an Automatic Identification System transponder or any other tracking device, it shall not be turned off or its effectiveness intentionally reduced. \\n\\n 35\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### PART 5 \\n\\n### PROTESTS, REDRESS, HEARINGS, MISCONDUCT AND APPEALS\\n\\n###### A hearing request form and a hearing decision form are available on the World Sailing website at: www.sailing.org/racingrules\\n\\n The Racing Rules of Sailing does not require a particular hearing request form to be used. \\n\\n SECTION A\\n#### PROTESTS; REDRESS; SUPPORT PERSONS\\n\\n###### 60 PROTESTS\\n\\n 60.1 Right to Protest\\n\\n A boat or committee may protest a boat.\\n\\n 60.2 Intention to Protest\\n\\n (a) If a protest concerns an incident observed by the protestor in the racing area:\\n\\n (1) If the protestor is a boat, she shall hail ‘Protest’ and, if her hull length is longer than 6 metres, conspicuously display a red flag, at the first reasonable opportunity for each. She shall display the flag until she is no longer racing.\\n\\n (2) If the protestor is a committee, it shall inform the boat after the race within the protest time limit of its intention to protest her.\\n\\n (b) However, if\\n\\n (1) the protestee is not within hailing distance at the time of the incident, \\n\\n (2) the incident was an error in sailing the course,\\n\\n (3) the incident was not observed by the protestor in the racing area, or\\n\\n 36\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (4) a protest committee decides to protest a boat under rule 60.4(c),\\n\\n then the only requirement for the protestor is to inform the protestee of its intention to protest at the first reasonable opportunity.\\n\\n (c) If at the time of the incident it is obvious to a protesting boat that a member of either crew is in danger, or that injury or serious damage has resulted, rules 60.2(a) and 60.2(b) do not apply to her, but she shall attempt to inform the other boat within the protest time limit of her intention to protest.\\n\\n (d) A committee may inform a boat of its intention to protest by posting a notice on the official notice board. \\n\\n 60.3 Delivering a Protest\\n\\n (a) When delivered, a protest shall be in writing and identify the protestor, the protestee, and the incident.\\n\\n (b) A protest shall be delivered to the race office (or by such other method as stated in the sailing instructions) within the protest time limit unless the protest committee decides there is good reason to extend the time. The protest time limit is\\n\\n (1) for protests about an incident observed in the racing area, two hours after the last boat in the race finishes, or\\n\\n (2) for other protests, two hours after the relevant information is available to the protestor.\\n\\n However, if the sailing instructions state a different protest time limit, then that time limit applies instead.\\n\\n 60.4 Protest Validity\\n\\n (a) A protest is invalid\\n\\n (1) if it does not comply with the definition Protest or rule 60.2 or 60.3,\\n\\n (2) if it is from a boat that alleges a breach of a rule of Part 2 or rule 31, but she was not involved in it or did not see the incident, or\\n\\n (3) as far as it alleges a breach of rule 69 or a Regulation referred to in rule 6, unless permitted by the Regulation concerned.\\n\\n 37\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (b) A protest is invalid also if it is from a committee and is based on information from\\n\\n (1) a request for redress,\\n\\n (2) an invalid protest, or\\n\\n (3) a report from a person with a conflict of interest (other than a representative of the boat herself).\\n\\n (c) However, rule 60.4(b) does not apply to a protest from\\n\\n (1) the protest committee if it learns of an incident involving a boat that may have resulted in injury or serious damage,\\n\\n (2) the protest committee if it learns during the hearing of a valid protest that the boat, although not a party to the hearing, was involved in the incident and may have broken a rule, or \\n\\n (3) the technical committee if it has first conducted an inspection and decided a boat or personal equipment does not comply with the class rules or rule 50.\\n\\n 60.5 Protest Decisions\\n\\n (a) The protest committee shall conduct a hearing as required by rule 63 to decide a protest.\\n\\n (b) A boat shall only be penalized\\n\\n (1) at a protest hearing to which she is a party,\\n\\n (2) under rule 62.4, 64 or 69, or\\n\\n (3) under a rule which expressly states that a penalty may be applied without a hearing.\\n\\n (c) If the protest committee decides that a boat has broken a rule it shall disqualify her whether or not the applicable rule was mentioned in the protest. However, the boat shall not be disqualified if \\n\\n (1) she is exonerated or some other penalty applies,\\n\\n (2) the boat has already taken an applicable penalty, in which case she shall not be penalized further unless the penalty for a rule she broke is disqualification that is not excludable, \\n\\n (3) the race is restarted or resailed, in which case rule 36 applies, or\\n\\n 38\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (4) she broke a class rule and rule 60.5(d) applies.\\n\\n If a boat has broken a rule when not racing, her penalty shall apply to the race sailed nearest in time to the incident.\\n\\n (d) If the protest committee decides that a boat has broken a class rule:\\n\\n (1) the boat shall not be penalized if any deviations in excess of tolerances specified in the class rules were caused by damage or normal wear and they did not improve the performance of the boat,\\n\\n (2) the boat shall not race again until any such deviations have been corrected unless the protest committee decides there is, or has been, no reasonable opportunity to do so,\\n\\n (3) any breach of the same rule in earlier races in the same event may have the same penalty imposed for all such races without further protest, and\\n\\n (4) the boat may compete in subsequent races without changes to the boat, but only if she states in writing that she intends to appeal.

When there is an equal division of votes, the chair of the hearing may cast an additional vote.\\n\\n (c) If there is a conflict between\\n\\n (1) two or more rules that must be resolved before a decision can be made, and\\n\\n (2) those rules are in the notice of race, the sailing instructions, or any of the other documents that govern the event under item (g) of the definition Rule,\\n then the protest committee shall apply the rule that it believes will provide the fairest result for all boats affected.\\n\\n (d) If the protest committee is in doubt about the meaning of a class rule, it shall refer its questions, together with the relevant facts, to an authority responsible for interpreting the rule. In\\n\\n 44\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### making its decision, the protest committee is bound by the authority’s reply.\\n\\n 63.6 Informing the Parties and Others\\n\\n (a) The protest committee shall promptly inform the parties to the hearing of the facts found, the applicable rules, the decision, the reasons for it, any penalties imposed, and any redress given. \\n\\n (b) If requested by a party in writing within seven days of being informed of the decision, the above information shall be provided promptly in writing and the protest committee may, if it considers it relevant to do so, prepare or endorse a diagram. \\n\\n (c) The protest committee may publish the above information after any hearing, including a hearing under rule 69, unless it decides there is good reason not to do so.\\n\\n (d) The protest committee may direct that the above information is to be confidential to the parties.\\n\\n (e) If the protest committee penalizes a boat under a class rule, it shall send the above information to the relevant class rule authorities. \\n\\n 63.7 Reopening a Hearing\\n\\n (a) The protest committee may reopen a hearing if it decides\\n\\n (1) a party was unavoidably absent from the hearing,\\n\\n (2) it may have made a significant error, or\\n\\n (3) significant new evidence has become available within a reasonable time.\\n\\n However, a protest committee shall reopen a hearing when required to do so by the national authority under rule 71.3 or R5.\\n\\n 45\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (b) A party to the hearing may request a reopening by delivering a written request to the race office (or by such other method as stated in the sailing instructions) no later than 24 hours after being informed of the decision. The request shall identify the reason for making it. However, on the last scheduled day of racing the request shall be delivered\\n\\n (1) within the protest time limit if the requesting party was informed of the decision on the previous day;\\n\\n (2) no later than 30 minutes after the party was informed of the decision on that day.\\n\\n A request that does not comply with this rule is invalid.\\n\\n (c) The protest committee shall consider all requests to reopen a hearing.

It shall not be grounds for a protest.\\n\\n 69.2 Action by a Protest Committee\\n\\n (a) A protest committee acting under this rule shall have at least three members. \\n\\n (b) When a protest committee, from its own observation or from information received from any source, including evidence taken during a hearing, believes a person may have broken rule 69.1(a), it shall decide whether or not to call a hearing. \\n\\n (c) When the protest committee needs more information to make the decision to call a hearing, it shall consider appointing a person or persons to conduct an investigation. These investigators shall not be members of the protest committee that will decide the matter. \\n\\n (d) When an investigator is appointed, all relevant information gathered by the investigator, favourable or unfavourable, shall be disclosed to the protest committee, and if the protest committee decides to call a hearing, to the parties. \\n\\n 47\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (e) If the protest committee decides to call a hearing, it shall promptly inform the person in writing of the alleged breach and of the time and place of the hearing and follow the procedures in rule 63, except that: \\n\\n (1) unless a person has been appointed by World Sailing, a person may be appointed by the protest committee to present the allegation. \\n\\n (2) a person against whom an allegation has been made under this rule shall be entitled to attend the hearing with an advisor and a representative who may act on the person’s behalf. \\n\\n (f) If a party\\n\\n (1) provides good reason for being unable to come to the hearing at the scheduled time, the protest committee shall reschedule it; or \\n\\n (2) does not provide good reason and does not come to the hearing, the protest committee may conduct it without that party present. \\n\\n (g) The standard of proof to be applied is the test of the comfortable satisfaction of the protest committee, bearing in mind the seriousness of the alleged misconduct. However, if the standard of proof in this rule conflicts with the laws of a country, the national authority may, with the approval of World Sailing, change it with a prescription to this rule. \\n\\n (h) When the protest committee decides that a competitor or boat owner has broken rule 69.1(a), it may take one or more of the following actions\\n\\n (1) issue a warning; \\n\\n (2) change their boat’s score in one or more races, including disqualification(s) that may or may not be excluded from her series score; \\n\\n (3) exclude the person from the event or venue or remove any privileges or benefits; and\\n\\n (4) take any other action within its jurisdiction as provided by the rules. \\n\\n (i) When the protest committee decides that a support person has broken rule 69.1(a), rules 62.3 and 62.4 apply.\\n\\n\\n###### 48\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (j) If the protest committee\\n\\n (1) imposes a penalty greater than one DNE; \\n\\n (2) excludes the person from the event or venue; or\\n\\n (3) in any other case if it considers it appropriate, \\n\\n it shall report its findings, including the facts found, its conclusions and decision to the national authority of the person or, for specific international events listed in the World Sailing Regulations, to World Sailing. If the protest committee has acted under rule 69.2(f)(2), the report shall also include that fact and the reasons for it. \\n\\n (k) If the protest committee decides not to conduct the hearing without a party present, or if the protest committee has left the event and a report alleging a breach of rule 69.1(a) is received, the race committee or organizing authority may appoint the same or a new protest committee to proceed under this rule. If the protest committee decides it is impractical to conduct a hearing, it shall collect all available information and, if the allegation seems justified, make a report to the national authority of the person or, for specific international events listed in the World Sailing Regulations, to World Sailing. \\n\\n 69.3 Action by a National Authority and World Sailing\\n\\n The disciplinary powers, procedures and responsibilities of national authorities and World Sailing that apply are specified in the World Sailing Code of Ethics. National authorities and World Sailing may impose further penalties, including suspension of eligibility, under that code. \\n\\n SECTION D\\n#### APPEALS\\n\\n###### 70 APPEALS AND REQUESTS TO A NATIONAL AUTHORITY\\n 70.1 Unless rule 70.3 applies, a party to a hearing has the right to appeal the protest committee’s decision or its procedures, but not the facts found, to the national authority.

However, if boats will pass through the waters of more than one national authority while racing, an appeal or request shall be sent to the national authority where the finishing line is located, unless the sailing instructions identify another national authority. \\n\\n 70.5 Appeals and requests shall conform to Appendix R.\\n\\n 71 NATIONAL AUTHORITY DECISIONS\\n 71.1 A person who has a conflict of interest or was a member of the protest committee shall not take any part in the discussion or decision on an appeal or a request for confirmation or correction. \\n\\n 71.2 The national authority shall accept the facts found by the protest committee unless rule R5 applies. \\n\\n 50\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 71.3 The national authority may:\\n (a) uphold, change or reverse the protest committee’s decision (including a decision on validity or a decision under rule 69), \\n\\n (b) order that the hearing be reopened, or\\n\\n (c) order that a new hearing be held by the same protest committee or by a new protest committee (which may be appointed by the national authority).\\n\\n 71.4 If the national authority orders a hearing to be reopened, it may limit the scope of the reopened hearing to such issues as it considers appropriate. \\n\\n 71.5 If the national authority decides that a boat that was a party to a protest hearing broke a rule and is not exonerated, it shall penalize her, whether or not that boat or that rule was mentioned in the protest committee’s decision. \\n\\n 71.6 The decision of the national authority is final. The national authority shall send its decision in writing to all parties to the hearing and the protest committee, who shall be bound by the decision.\\n\\n 72 INTERPRETATIONS\\n\\n A club or other organization affiliated to a national authority may request an interpretation of the rules from the national authority, provided that no protest committee decision that may be appealed is involved. An interpretation shall not be used to change a previous protest committee decision.\\n\\n 51\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### PART 6\\n\\n### ENTRY AND QUALIFICATION\\n\\n###### 75 ENTERING AN EVENT\\n\\n To enter an event, a boat shall comply with the requirements of the organizing authority of the event.

In addition, the boat shall also comply at other times specified in the class rules, the notice of race or the sailing instructions. When a rule provides that the penalty for a breach of a class rule may be less than disqualification, the same penalty will apply to a breach of this rule. \\n\\n 78.2 When a rule requires a valid certificate to be produced or its existence verified before a boat races, and this cannot be done, the boat may race provided that the appropriate committee receives a statement signed by the person in charge that a valid certificate exists. The boat shall produce the certificate or arrange for its existence to be verified by the appropriate committee before the start of the last day of the event, or of the first series, whichever is earlier. The penalty for breaking this rule is disqualification without a hearing from all races of the event.\\n\\n 79 CATEGORIZATION\\n\\n If the notice of race or class rules state that some or all competitors must satisfy categorization requirements, the categorization shall be carried out as described in the World Sailing Sailor Categorization Code.\\n\\n 80 RESCHEDULED EVENT\\n\\n When an event is rescheduled to dates different from the dates stated in the notice of race, all boats entered shall be notified.

However, if a boat is penalized for breaking a rule of Part 2 and if she in the same incident breaks rule 31, she shall not be penalized for breaking rule 31. Furthermore, a boat that displays an incorrect flag or does not display the correct flag shall be warned orally and given an opportunity to correct the error before being penalized.\\n\\n C8.3 When the umpires decide that a boat has\\n\\n (a) gained an advantage by breaking a rule after allowing for a penalty,\\n\\n (b) deliberately broken a rule, or\\n\\n (c) committed a breach of sportsmanship,\\n\\n she shall be penalized under rule C5.2, C5.3 or C5.4.\\n\\n C8.4 If the umpires or protest committee members decide that a boat may have broken a rule other than those listed in rules C6.1(a) and C6.2, they shall so inform the protest committee for its action under rule 60.1 and rule C6.6 when appropriate.\\n\\n 82\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n C8.5 When, after one boat has started, the umpires are satisfied that the other boat will not start, they may signal under rule C5.4, identifying the boat that has not started. \\n\\n C8.6 When one boat retires after both boats in a match have started, the umpires may signal under rule C5.4, identifying the retired boat. \\n\\n C8.7 When the match umpires, together with at least one other umpire, decide that a boat has broken rule 14 and damage resulted, they may impose a points-penalty without a hearing. The competitor shall be informed of the penalty as soon as practicable and, at the time of being so informed, may request a hearing. The protest committee shall then proceed under rule C6.6. Any penalty decided by the protest committee may be more than the penalty imposed by the umpires.

Rule 63.7(b) is changed to: ‘A party to the hearing may not ask for a reopening.’\\n\\n C9.2 A competitor may not base a request for redress on a claim that an action by an official boat was improper. The protest committee may decide to consider giving redress in such circumstances but only if it believes that an official boat, including an umpire boat, may have seriously interfered with a competing boat.\\n\\n C9.3 No proceedings of any kind may be taken in relation to any action or non-action by the umpires, except as permitted in rule C9.2.\\n\\n C10 SCORING\\n C10.1 The winning competitor of each match scores one point (half a point\\n each for a dead heat); the loser scores no points.\\n\\n C10.2 When a competitor withdraws from part of an event the scores of all\\n completed races shall stand.\\n\\n C10.3 When a single round robin is terminated before completion, or a\\n multiple round robin is terminated during the first round robin, a competitor's score shall be the average points scored per match sailed\\n\\n 83\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n by the competitor. However, if any of the competitors have completed less than one-third of the scheduled matches, the entire round robin shall be disregarded and, if necessary, the event declared void. For the purposes of tie-breaking in rule C11.1(a), a competitor’s score shall be the average points scored per match between the tied competitors.\\n\\n C10.4 When a multiple round robin is terminated with an incomplete round\\n robin, only one point shall be available for all the matches sailed between any two competitors, as follows:\\n\\n\\n###### Number of matches completed between any two competitors\\n\\n\\n###### Points for each win\\n\\n\\n###### 1 One point\\n\\n 2 Half a point\\n\\n 3 A third of a point\\n\\n (etc.)\\n\\n C10.5 In a round-robin series,\\n\\n (a) competitors shall be placed in order of their total scores, highest score first;\\n\\n (b) a competitor who has won a match but is disqualified for breaking a rule against a competitor in another match shall lose the point for that match (but the losing competitor shall not be awarded the point); and\\n\\n (c) the overall position between competitors who have sailed in different groups shall be decided by the highest score.\\n\\n C10.6 In a knockout series the sailing instructions shall state the minimum\\n number of points required to win a series between two competitors. When a knockout series is terminated it shall be decided in favour of the competitor with the higher score.\\n\\n C10.7 When only one boat in a match fails to sail the course, she shall be\\n scored no points (without a hearing).\\n\\n 84\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n C11 TIES\\n\\n C11.1 Round-Robin Series\\n\\n In a round-robin series competitors are assigned to one or more groups and scheduled to sail against all other competitors in their group one or more times. Each separate stage identified in the event format shall be a separate round-robin series irrespective of the number of times each competitor sails against each other competitor in that stage.\\n\\n Ties between two or more competitors in a round-robin series shall be broken by the following methods, in order, until all ties are broken. When one or more ties are only partially broken, rules C11.1(a) to C11.1(e) shall be re-applied to them. Ties shall be decided in favour of the competitor(s) who\\n\\n (a) placed in order, has the highest score in the matches between the tied competitors;\\n\\n (b) when the tie is between two competitors in a multiple round robin, has won the last match between the two competitors;\\n\\n (c) has the most points against the competitor placed highest in the round-robin series or, if necessary, second highest, and so on until the tie is broken. When two separate ties have to be resolved but the resolution of each depends upon resolving the other, the following principles shall be used in the rule C11.1(c) procedure:\\n\\n (1) the higher-place tie shall be resolved before the lower- place tie, and\\n\\n (2) all the competitors in the lower-place tie shall be treated as a single competitor for the purposes of rule C11.1(c);\\n\\n (d) after applying rule C10.5(c), has the highest place in the different groups, irrespective of the number of competitors in each group;\\n\\n (e) has the highest place in the most recent stage of the event (fleet race, round robin, etc.).\\n\\n C11.2 Knockout Series\\n Ties (including 0–0) between competitors in a knockout series shall be broken by the following methods, in order, until the tie is broken. The tie shall be decided in favour of the competitor who\\n\\n 85\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n (a) has the highest place in the most recent round-robin series, applying rule C11.1 if necessary;\\n\\n (b) has won the most recent match in the event between the tied competitors.\\n\\n C11.3 Remaining Ties\\n\\n When rule C11.1 or C11.2 does not resolve a tie,\\n\\n (a) if the tie needs to be resolved for a later stage of the event (or another event for which the event is a direct qualifier), the tie shall be broken by a sail-off when practicable. When the race committee decides that a sail-off is not practicable, the tie shall be decided in favour of the competitor who has the highest score in the round-robin series after eliminating the score for the first race for each tied competitor or, should this fail to break the tie, the second race for each tied competitor and so on until the tie is broken. When a tie is partially resolved, the remaining tie shall be broken by reapplying rule C11.1 or C11.2.\\n\\n (b) to decide the winner of an event that is not a direct qualifier  for another event, or the overall position between competitors eliminated in one round of a knockout series, a sail-off may be used (but not a draw).\\n\\n (c) when a tie is not broken any monetary prizes or ranking points for tied places shall be added together and divided equally among the tied competitors.\\n\\n 86\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### APPENDIX D\\n\\n### TEAM RACING RULES\\n\\n###### Team races shall be sailed under The Racing Rules of Sailing as changed by this appendix.\\n\\n D1 CHANGES TO THE RACING RULES\\n\\n D1.1 Definitions and the Rules of Parts 2 and 4\\n\\n (a) In the definition Zone the distance is changed to two hull lengths.\\n\\n (b) Rule 18.2(a) is changed to:\\n\\n (a) When the first of two boats reaches the zone,\\n\\n (1) if the boats are overlapped, the outside boat at that moment shall give the inside boat mark-room;\\n\\n (2) if the boats are not overlapped, the boat that has not reached the zone at that moment shall give the other boat mark-room.\\n\\n If a boat passes head to wind and at that moment is clear astern of a boat in the zone, she shall give the clear- ahead boat mark-room.\\n\\n When a boat is required to give mark-room by this rule, she shall continue to do so for as long as this rule applies, even if later an overlap is broken or a new overlap begins. \\n\\n (c) Rule 18.4 is deleted.\\n\\n (d) When stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions, rule 20.4 is changed so that the following arm signals are required in addition to the hails:\\n\\n (1) for ‘Room to tack’, repeatedly and clearly pointing to windward; and\\n\\n (2) for ‘You tack’, repeatedly and clearly pointing at the other boat and waving the arm to windward.\\n\\n (e) Rule 23.1 is changed to: ‘If reasonably possible, a boat not racing shall not interfere with a boat that is racing, and a boat that has finished shall not act to interfere with a boat that has not finished.’\\n 87\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n (f) Add new rule 23.3: ‘When boats in different races meet, any change of course by either boat shall be consistent with complying with a rule or trying to win her own race.’\\n\\n (g) Add to rule 41:\\n\\n (e) help from another boat on her team provided electronic communication is not used.\\n\\n (h) Rule 45 is deleted.\\n\\n D1.2 Protests and Requests for Redress\\n\\n (a) A boat may\\n\\n (1) protest another boat, but her protest is invalid if it alleges a breach of a rule of Part 2 and she was not involved in the incident, unless the incident involved contact between boats (This changes rule 60.4(a)(2).);\\n\\n (2) remove her red flag after it has been conspicuously displayed (This changes rule 60.2(a)(1).);\\n\\n (3) request redress, but not for damage or injury caused by another boat on her team (This changes rule 61.1(a).). \\n\\n (b) The race committee and protest committee shall not protest a boat for breaking a rule of Part 2 except\\n\\n (1) based on evidence in a report from an umpire after a black and white flag has been displayed; or\\n\\n (2) under rule 14 upon receipt of a report from any source alleging damage or injury.\\n\\n (c) Protests and requests for redress need not be in writing.

A match is one or more races between two teams.\\n\\n D4.2 Event Format\\n\\n (a) The notice of race or sailing instructions shall state the format and stages of the event, and any special scoring rules.\\n\\n (b) In order to conclude an event, the race committee may change or terminate any part of the format at any reasonable time taking into account the entries, weather, time constraints and other relevant factors.\\n\\n D4.3 Scoring a Round-Robin Stage\\n\\n (a) Teams in a round-robin group shall be ranked in order of number of race wins, highest first. If the teams have not completed an equal number of races, they shall be ranked in order of the percentage of races won, highest first.\\n\\n (b) However, if a round-robin is terminated when fewer than 80% of its scheduled races have been completed, its race results shall not be included, but shall be used to break ties between teams in the group who all sailed each other in the terminated round-robin.\\n\\n (c) Results from a previous round-robin stage shall only be carried forward if stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions.\\n\\n D4.4 Round-Robin Tie Breaks\\n\\n Ties in a round-robin stage shall be broken using results from that stage only.\\n\\n (a) If the tied teams have all sailed each other at least once in the stage, the tie shall be broken in the order below.\\n\\n 92\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n (1) Percentage of races won in all races between the tied teams, highest first;\\n\\n (2) Average points per race in all races between the tied teams, lowest first;\\n\\n (3) If two teams remain tied, the winner of the last race between them;\\n\\n (4) Average points per race in all races against common opponents, lowest first;\\n\\n (5) A sail-off if possible, otherwise a game of chance.\\n\\n (b) Otherwise, the tie shall be broken using only steps (4) and (5) above.\\n\\n (c) When a tie is partially broken by one of the above, the remaining tie shall be broken in accordance with D4.4(a) or (b) as appropriate.\\n\\n D4.5 Scoring a Knockout Stage\\n\\n (a) A round shall not be scored unless at least one race has been completed in each match in that round. The final and petit-final are separate rounds.\\n\\n (b) The winner of a match shall be the first team to score the number of race wins stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions.

It may take evidence in any way it considers appropriate and may communicate its decision orally.\\n\\n D5.4 When the race committee decides that the team’s score was made significantly worse, that the breakdown was through no fault of the crew, and that in the same circumstances a reasonably competent crew would not have been able to avoid the breakdown, it shall make as equitable a decision as possible. This may be to abandon and resail the race or, when the boat’s finishing place was predictable, award her points for that place. Any doubt about a boat’s position when she broke down shall be resolved against her. \\n\\n D5.5 A breakdown caused by defective supplied equipment or a breach of a rule by an opponent shall not normally be determined to be the fault of the crew, but one caused by careless handling, capsizing or a breach by a boat on the same team shall be. If there is doubt, it shall be presumed that the crew are not at fault.\\n\\n 94\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### APPENDIX E\\n\\n### RADIO SAILING RACING RULES\\n\\n###### Radio sailing races shall be sailed under The Racing Rules of Sailing as changed by this appendix.\\n\\n Note: A Test Rule for Umpired Radio Sailing is available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n E1 CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS, TERMINOLOGY AND THE RULES OF PARTS 1, 2 AND 7\\n\\n E1.1 Definitions\\n\\n Add to the definition Conflict of Interest:\\n\\n However, an observer does not have a conflict of interest solely by being a competitor.\\n\\n In the definition Zone the distance is changed to four hull lengths.\\n\\n Add new definition:\\n\\n Disabled  A boat is disabled while she is unable to continue in the heat.\\n\\n E1.2 Terminology\\n\\n The Terminology paragraph of the Introduction is changed so that:\\n\\n (a) ‘Boat’ means a sailboat that is subject to the rules, controlled by radio signals and has no crew.

The term ‘boat’ elsewhere in the rules means ‘kiteboard’ or ‘boat’ as appropriate. \\n\\n Note: Links to kiteboard rules for some other formats or competitions can be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS\\n\\n The definitions Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap, Continuing Obstruction, Finish, Keep Clear, Leeward and Windward, Mark- Room, Obstruction, Start, Tack, Starboard or Port and Zone are changed to:\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap One kiteboard is clear astern of another when her hull is behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other kiteboard’s hull. The other kiteboard is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a kiteboard between them overlaps both. If there is reasonable doubt that two kiteboards are overlapped, it shall be presumed that they are not. These terms always apply to kiteboards on the same tack. They apply to kiteboards on opposite tacks only when both kiteboards are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Continuing Obstruction  An obstruction is a continuing obstruction when a kiteboard will pass alongside it for at least 30 metres. However, the following are not a continuing obstruction: a vessel under way, a kiteboard racing, or a race committee vessel that is also a mark. \\n\\n Finish A kiteboard finishes when, after her starting signal, while the competitor is in contact with the hull, any part of her hull, or the competitor, crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or\\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course.\\n\\n 106\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### After finishing she need not cross the finishing line completely. The sailing instructions may change the direction in which kiteboards are required to cross the finishing line to finish. \\n\\n Keep Clear A kiteboard keeps clear of a right-of-way kiteboard\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way kiteboard can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and,\\n\\n (b) if the right-of-way kiteboard can also change course in both directions or move her kite in any direction without immediately making contact.\\n\\n Leeward and Windward A kiteboard’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her kite lies. The other side is her windward side. When two kiteboards on the same tack overlap, the one whose hull is on the leeward side of the other’s hull is the leeward kiteboard. The other is the windward kiteboard.\\n\\n Mark-Room Room for a kiteboard to sail no farther from the mark than needed to sail her proper course to round or pass the mark on the required side, and room to pass a finishing mark after finishing. \\n\\n Obstruction  An obstruction is\\n\\n (a) an object that a kiteboard could not pass without substantially changing her course or the position of her kite, if she were sailing directly towards it and 10 metres from it;\\n\\n (b) an object that is so designated in a rule;\\n\\n (c) an object that can be safely passed on only one side; or\\n\\n (d) an area or line in a rule that kiteboards are prohibited from entering or crossing.\\n\\n However, a kiteboard racing is not an obstruction to other kiteboards unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. \\n\\n Start A kiteboard starts when, her hull and the competitor having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, any part of her hull or the competitor crosses the starting line from the pre-start side to the course side.\\n\\n 107\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port A kiteboard is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to the competitor’s hand that would be forward if the competitor were in normal riding position (riding heel side with both hands on the control bar and arms not crossed). A kiteboard is on starboard tack when the competitor’s right hand would be forward and is on the port tack when the competitor’s left hand would be forward.\\n\\n Zone The area around a mark within a distance of 30 metres. A kiteboard is in the zone when any part of her hull is in the zone.\\n\\n Add the following definitions:\\n\\n Capsized A kiteboard is capsized if\\n\\n (a) her kite is in the water, or\\n\\n (b) her lines are tangled with another kiteboard’s lines.\\n\\n Jumping A kiteboard is jumping when her hull, its appendages and the competitor are clear of the water.\\n\\n Recovering A kiteboard is recovering from the time she loses steerage way until she regains it, unless she is capsized.\\n\\n F1 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 1\\n\\n [No changes.]\\n\\n F2 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 2\\n PART 2 — PREAMBLE\\n In the second sentence of the preamble, ‘injury or serious damage’ is changed to ‘injury, serious damage or a tangle’.\\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n Rule 13 is deleted.\\n\\n 16 CHANGING COURSE OR KITE POSITION\\n\\n Rule 16 is changed to:\\n\\n 16.1 When a right-of-way kiteboard changes course or the position\\n of her kite, she shall give the other kiteboard room to continue keeping clear.\\n\\n 108\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n\\n###### 16.2 In addition, on a beat to windward when a port-tack kiteboard\\n is keeping clear by sailing to pass to leeward of a starboard- tack kiteboard, the starboard-tack kiteboard shall not bear away or change the position of her kite if as a result the port- tack kiteboard must change course or the position of her kite immediately to continue keeping clear.\\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK; PROPER COURSE\\n\\n Rule 17 is deleted.\\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n Rule 18 is changed to:\\n\\n 18.1 When Rule 18 Applies\\n\\n Rule 18 applies between kiteboards when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is in the zone.

It is addressed primarily to the protest committee chair but may also help judges, protest committee secretaries, race committees and others involved in hearings.\\n\\n In a hearing, the protest committee should weigh all testimony with equal care; should recognize that honest testimony can vary, and even be in conflict, as a result of different observations and recollections; should resolve such differences as best it can; should recognize that no boat or competitor is guilty until a breach of a rule has been established to the satisfaction of the protest committee; and should keep an open mind until all the evidence has been heard as to whether a boat or competitor has broken a rule.\\n\\n M1 PRELIMINARIES (may be performed by race office staff)\\n\\n (a) Receive the hearing request. \\n\\n (b) Note the time the hearing request is delivered and the protest time limit. \\n\\n (c) Inform each party, including any committee involved, when and where the hearing will be held (rule 63.1(a)(1)). \\n\\n M2 BEFORE THE HEARING\\n M2.1 Make sure that\\n\\n (a) each party has the opportunity to read the protest, request for redress or allegation and has had reasonable time to prepare for the hearing (rules 63.1(a)(2) and 63.1(a)(3)).\\n\\n (b) only one person from each party is present unless an interpreter is needed (rule 63.1(a)(4)).\\n\\n (c) all boats and people involved are represented. If they are not, however, the committee may proceed under rule 63.1(b).\\n\\n (d) boats’ representatives were on board when required (rule 63.1(a)(4)). \\n\\n 129\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n (e) when the parties were in different events, both organizing authorities accept the composition of the protest committee (rule 63.2(e)). \\n\\n (f) in a protest concerning class rules, obtain the current class rules and identify the authority responsible for interpreting them (rule 63.5(d)).\\n\\n M2.2 Determine if any members of the protest committee saw the incident. If so, require each of them to state that fact as soon as possible at the hearing (rule 63.4(d)).\\n\\n M2.3 Assess conflicts of interest.\\n\\n (a) Ensure that all protest committee members declare any possible conflicts of interest. At major events this will often be a formal written declaration made before the event starts that will be kept with the protest committee records.\\n\\n (b) At the start of any hearing, ensure that the parties are aware of any conflicts of interest of protest committee members. Ask the parties if they consent to the members. If a party does not object as soon as possible after a conflict of interest has been declared, the protest committee may take this as consent to proceed and should record it.\\n\\n (c) If a party objects to a member, the remainder of the protest committee members need to assess whether the conflict of interest is significant. The assessment will consider the level of the event, the level of the conflict and the perception of fairness. It may be acceptable to balance conflicts between protest committee members. Guidance may be found on the World Sailing website. Record the decision and the grounds for that decision.\\n\\n (d) In cases of doubt it may be preferable to proceed with a smaller protest committee. Except for hearings under rule 69, there is no minimum number of protest committee members required.\\n\\n (e) When a request for redress is made under rule 61.4(b)(1) and is based on an improper action or omission of a body other than the protest committee, a member of that body should not be a member of the protest committee.\\n\\n 130\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M3 THE HEARING\\n M3.1 Check that the protest or request is valid.\\n\\n (a) Are the contents adequate (rule 60.3(a), 61.2(a) or 63.7(b))?\\n\\n (b) Was it delivered in time? If not, is there good reason to extend the time limit (rule 60.3(b), 61.2(b) or 63.7(b))?\\n\\n (c) When required, was the protestor involved in or a witness to the incident (rule 60.4(a)(2))?\\n\\n (d) When necessary, was ‘Protest’ hailed and, if required, a red flag displayed correctly (rule 60.2(a)(1))?\\n\\n (e) When the flag or hail was not necessary, was the protestee informed (rule 60.2(b))?\\n\\n (f) Decide whether the protest or request for redress is valid (rule 63.4(a)).\\n\\n (g) Once the validity of the protest or request has been determined, do not let the subject be introduced again unless truly new evidence is available.\\n\\n M3.2 Take the evidence (rule 63.4).\\n\\n (a) Ask the parties to tell their stories. Then allow them to question one another. In a redress matter, ask the party to state the request.\\n\\n (b) Make sure you know what facts each party is alleging before calling any witnesses. Their stories may be different.\\n\\n (c) Allow anyone, including a boat’s crew, to give evidence. It is the party who normally decides which witnesses to call, although the protest committee may also call witnesses (rule 63.4(b)). The question asked by a party ‘Would you like to hear N?’ is best answered by ‘It is your choice.’\\n\\n (d) Call each party’s witnesses (and the protest committee’s if any) one by one. Limit parties to questioning the witness(es). (They may wander into general statements.)\\n\\n (e) Invite the protestee to question the protestor’s witness first (and vice versa). This prevents the protestor from leading the witness from the beginning. \\n\\n (f) Allow members of the protest committee who saw the incident to give evidence (rule 63.4(d)). Members who give evidence\\n\\n 131\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n may be questioned, should take care to relate all they know about the incident that could affect the decision, and may remain on the protest committee (rule 63.4(e)).\\n\\n (g) Try to prevent leading questions, but if that is impossible discount the evidence so obtained.\\n\\n (h) The protest committee chair should advise a party or a witness giving hearsay, repetitive or irrelevant evidence that the protest committee must give such evidence appropriate weight, which may be little or no weight at all (rules 63.4(b) and 63.5(a)).\\n\\n (i) Ask one member of the committee to note down evidence, particularly times, distances, speeds, etc.\\n\\n (j) Invite questions from protest committee members.\\n\\n (k) Invite each party, starting with the party that requested the hearing, to make a final statement of her case, particularly on any application or interpretation of the rules.\\n\\n M3.3 Find the facts (rule 63.5(a)).\\n\\n (a) Write down the facts; resolve doubts one way or the other.\\n\\n (b) Call back parties for more questions if necessary.\\n\\n (c) When appropriate, draw a diagram of the incident using the facts you have found.\\n\\n M3.4 Decide the case (rule 63.5).\\n\\n (a) Base the decision on the facts found. (If you cannot, find some more facts.)\\n\\n (b) In redress cases, make sure that no further evidence is needed from boats that will be affected by the decision.\\n\\n M3.5 Inform the parties (rule 63.6).\\n\\n (a) Recall the parties and read them the facts found, conclusions and rules that apply, and the decision. When time presses it is permissible to read the decision and give the details later.\\n\\n (b) Give any party a copy of the decision on request. File the protest or request for redress with the committee records.\\n\\n 132\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M4 REOPENING A HEARING (rule 63.7)\\n M4.1 When a party, within the time limit, has asked for a hearing to be reopened, hear the party making the request, look at any video, etc., and decide whether there is any significant new evidence that might lead you to change your decision. Decide whether your interpretation of the rules may have been wrong; be open-minded as to whether you have made a mistake. If none of these applies refuse to reopen; otherwise schedule a hearing.\\n\\n M4.2 Evidence is ‘new’\\n\\n (a) if it was not reasonably possible for the party asking for the reopening to have discovered the evidence before the original hearing,\\n\\n (b) if the protest committee is satisfied that before the original hearing the evidence was diligently but unsuccessfully sought by the party asking for the reopening, or\\n\\n (c) if the protest committee learns from any source that the evidence was not available to the parties at the time of the original hearing.\\n\\n M5 DISCRETIONARY PENALTIES (rule 64) \\n\\n Rule 64 enables a boat that has broken a rule subject to a discretionary penalty to comply with Sportsmanship and the Rules by reporting within the protest time limit that she has broken the rule. If the report does not include sufficient facts for the protest committee to decide what penalty to impose, the committee may question a representative of the boat and any witnesses to collect evidence it decides is appropriate. It is not necessary to conduct a hearing to collect this evidence. Note that guidelines for discretionary penalties may be found on the World Sailing website. \\n\\n M6 MISCONDUCT (rule 69)\\n M6.1 An action under this rule is not a protest, but the protest committee gives its allegations in writing to the competitor before the hearing. The hearing is conducted under rule 63, but the protest committee must have at least three members (rule 69.2(a)). Use the greatest care to protect the competitor’s rights.\\n\\n 133\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M6.2 A competitor or a boat cannot protest under rule 69, but the hearing request form of a competitor who tries to do so may be accepted as a report to the protest committee, which can then decide whether or not to call a hearing.\\n\\n M6.3 Unless World Sailing has appointed a person for the role, the protest committee may appoint a person to present the allegation. This person might be a race official, the person making the allegation or other appropriate person. When no reasonable alternative person is available, a person who was appointed as a member of the protest committee may present the allegation.\\n\\n M6.4 When it is desirable to call a hearing under rule 69 as a result of a Part 2 incident, it is important to hear any boat-vs.-boat protest in the normal way, deciding which boat, if any, broke which rule, before proceeding against the competitor under rule 69.\\n\\n M6.5 Although action under rule 69 is taken against a competitor, boat owner or support person, and not a boat, a boat may also be penalized (rules 69.2(h)(2) and 62.4).\\n\\n M6.6 When a protest committee upholds a rule 69 allegation it will need to consider if it is appropriate to report to either a national authority or World Sailing. Guidance on when to report may be found in the World Sailing Case Book. When the protest committee does make a report, it may recommend whether or not further action should be taken.\\n\\n M6.7 Unless the right of appeal is denied in accordance with rule 70.3, a party to a rule 69 hearing may appeal the decision of the protest committee.\\n\\n M6.8 Further guidance for protest committees about misconduct may be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n M7 APPEALS (rule 70 and Appendix R)\\n\\n When decisions can be appealed,\\n\\n (a) retain the papers relevant to the hearing so that the information can easily be used for an appeal. Is there a diagram endorsed or prepared by the protest committee? Are the facts found sufficient? (Example: Was there an overlap? Yes or No. ‘Perhaps’ is not a fact found.) Are the names of the protest\\n\\n 134\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n committee members and other important information on the form?\\n\\n (b) comments by the protest committee on any appeal should enable the appeals committee to picture the whole incident clearly; the appeals committee knows nothing about the situation.\\n\\n M8 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE\\n\\n Photographs and videos can sometimes provide useful evidence but protest committees should recognize their limitations and note the following points:\\n\\n (a) The party producing the photographic evidence is responsible for arranging the viewing.\\n\\n (b) View the video several times to extract all the information from it.\\n\\n (c) The depth perception of any single-lens camera is very poor; with a telephoto lens it is non-existent. When the camera views two overlapped boats at right angles to their course, it is impossible to assess the distance between them. When the camera views them head on, it is impossible to see whether an overlap exists unless it is substantial.\\n\\n (d) Ask the following questions:\\n\\n (1) Where was the camera in relation to the boats?\\n\\n (2) Was the camera’s platform moving? If so in what\\n direction and how fast?\\n\\n (3) Is the angle changing as the boats approach the critical\\n point? Fast panning causes radical change.\\n\\n (4) Did the camera have an unrestricted view throughout?\\n\\n 135\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### APPENDIX N\\n\\n### INTERNATIONAL JURIES\\n\\n###### See rules 70.3(a) and 91(b). This appendix shall not be changed by the notice of race, sailing instructions or national prescriptions.\\n\\n N1 COMPOSITION, APPOINTMENT AND ORGANIZATION\\n N1.1 An international jury shall be composed of experienced sailors with excellent knowledge of the racing rules and extensive protest committee experience. It shall be independent of and have no members from the race committee or the technical committee, and it shall be appointed by the organizing authority, subject to approval by the national authority if required (see rule 91(b)), or by World Sailing under rule 89.2(c).\\n\\n N1.2 The jury shall consist of a chair, a vice chair if desired, and other members for a total of at least five. A majority shall be International Judges.\\n\\n N1.3 No more than two members (three, in Groups M, N and Q) shall be from the same national authority.\\n\\n N1.4 (a) The chair of a jury may appoint one or more panels composed in compliance with rules N1.1, N1.2 and N1.3. This can be done even if the full jury is not composed in compliance with these rules.\\n\\n (b) The chair of a jury may appoint panels of at least three members each, of which the majority shall be International Judges. Members of each panel shall be from at least three different national authorities except in Groups M, N and Q, where they shall be from at least two different national authorities. If dissatisfied with a panel’s decision, a party is entitled to a hearing by a panel composed in compliance with rules N1.1, N1.2 and N1.3, except concerning the facts found, if requested within 30 minutes, or the time limit specified in the sailing instructions, after being informed of the decision. \\n\\n N1.5 When a full jury, or a panel, has fewer than five members, because of illness or emergency, and no qualified replacements are available, it remains properly constituted if it consists of at least three members\\n\\n 136\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n and if at least two of them are International Judges. When there are three or four members they shall be from at least three different national authorities except in Groups M, N and Q, where they shall be from at least two different national authorities.\\n\\n N1.6 When it is considered desirable that some members not participate in discussing and deciding a protest or request for redress, and no qualified replacements are available, the jury or panel remains properly constituted if at least three members remain and at least two of them are International Judges.\\n\\n N1.7 In exception to rules N1.1 and N1.2, World Sailing may in limited circumstances authorize an international jury consisting of a total of only three members. All members shall be International Judges. The members shall be from three different national authorities (two, in Groups M, N and Q). The authorization shall be stated in a letter of approval to the organizing authority and in the notice of race or sailing instructions, and the letter shall be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n N1.8 When the national authority’s approval is required for the appointment of an international jury (see rule 91(b)), notice of its approval shall be included in the sailing instructions or be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n N1.9 If the jury or a panel acts while not properly constituted, its decisions may be appealed.\\n\\n N2 RESPONSIBILITIES\\n N2.1 An international jury is responsible for hearing and deciding all protests, requests for redress and other matters arising under the rules of Part 5. When asked by the organizing authority, the race committee or the technical committee, it shall advise and assist them on any matter directly affecting the fairness of the competition.\\n\\n N2.2 Unless the organizing authority directs otherwise, the jury shall decide\\n\\n (a) questions of eligibility, measurement or rating certificates; and\\n\\n (b) whether to authorize the substitution of competitors, boats or equipment when a rule requires such a decision.\\n\\n 137\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n N2.3 The jury shall also decide matters referred to it by the organizing authority, the race committee or the technical committee.\\n N3 PROCEDURES\\n\\n N3.1 Members shall not be regarded as having a significant conflict of interest (see rule 63.3) by reason of their nationality, club membership or similar. When otherwise considering a significant conflict of interest as required by rule 63.3, considerable weight must be given to the fact that decisions of an international jury cannot be appealed and this may affect the perception of fairness and lower the level of conflict that is significant. In case of doubt, the hearing should proceed as permitted by rule N1.6.\\n\\n N3.2 If a panel fails to agree on a decision it may adjourn, in which case the chair shall refer the matter to a properly constituted panel with as many members as possible, which may be the full jury.\\n\\n N4 MISCONDUCT (Rule 69)\\n N4.1 The World Sailing Code of Ethics contains procedures that apply to specific international events with regard to the appointment of a person to conduct any investigation. These procedures override any conflicting provision of this appendix. \\n\\n N4.2 A person shall be responsible for presenting to the hearing panel any allegations of misconduct under rule 69. This person shall not be a member of the hearing panel but may be a member of the jury. Such a person shall be required to make full disclosure of all material gathered in the course of the investigation to the person subject to allegations of a breach of rule 69. \\n\\n N4.3 Prior to a hearing, the hearing panel, to the extent practically possible, shall not act as an investigator of any allegations made under rule 69. However, during the hearing the panel shall be entitled to ask any investigative questions it may see fit.\\n\\n N4.4 If the panel decides to call a hearing, all material disclosed to the panel in order for them to make that decision must be disclosed to the person subject to the allegations before the hearing begins.\\n\\n 138\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### APPENDIX P\\n\\n### SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR RULE 42\\n\\n###### All or part of this appendix applies only if the notice of race or sailing instructions so state.\\n\\n P1 OBSERVERS AND PROCEDURE\\n P1.1 The protest committee may appoint observers, including protest committee members, to act in accordance with rule P1.2. A person with a significant conflict of interest shall not be appointed as an observer.\\n\\n P1.2 If an observer appointed under rule P1.1 decides that a boat has broken rule 42, the boat may be penalized by, as soon as reasonably possible making a sound signal, pointing a yellow flag at her, and clearly identifying her by hailing, even if she is no longer racing. A boat so penalized shall not be penalized a second time under rule 42 for the same incident. \\n\\n P2 PENALTIES\\n\\n P2.1 First Penalty\\n\\n When a boat is first penalized under rule P1.2 her penalty shall be a Two-Turns Penalty under rule 44.2. If she fails to take it she shall be disqualified without a hearing.\\n\\n P2.2 Second Penalty\\n\\n When a boat is penalized a second time during the event, she shall promptly retire. If she fails to do so she shall be disqualified without a hearing and her score shall not be excluded.\\n\\n P2.3 Third and Subsequent Penalties\\n\\n When a boat is penalized a third or subsequent time during the event, she shall promptly retire. If she does so her penalty shall be disqualification without a hearing and her score shall not be excluded. If she fails to do so her penalty shall be disqualification without a hearing from all races in the event, with no score excluded, and the protest committee shall consider calling a hearing under rule 69.2.\\n\\n 139\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n P2.4 Penalties near the Finishing Line\\n\\n If a boat is penalized under rule P2.2 or P2.3 and it was not reasonably possible for her to retire before finishing, she shall be scored as if she had retired promptly.\\n\\n P3 POSTPONEMENT, GENERAL RECALL OR ABANDONMENT\\n\\n If a boat has been penalized under rule P1.2 and the race committee signals a postponement, general recall or abandonment, the penalty is cancelled, but it is still counted to determine the number of times she has been penalized during the event.\\n\\n P4 REDRESS LIMITATION\\n\\n A boat shall not be given redress for an action by a member of the protest committee or its designated observer under rule P1.2 unless the action was improper due to a failure to take into account a race committee signal or a class rule.\\n\\n P5 FLAGS O AND R\\n\\n P5.1 When Rule P5 Applies\\n\\n Rule P5 applies if the class rules permit pumping, rocking and ooching when the wind speed exceeds a specified limit.\\n\\n P5.2 Before the Starting Signal\\n\\n (a) The race committee may signal that pumping, rocking and ooching are permitted, as specified in the class rules, by displaying flag O before or with the warning signal.\\n\\n (b) If the wind speed becomes less than the specified limit after flag O has been displayed, the race committee may postpone the race.

Further guidance on arbitration can be found in the World Sailing Judges Manual, which is available on the World Sailing website. \\n\\n T1 POST-RACE PENALTIES\\n\\n (a) Provided that rule 44.1(b) does not apply, a boat that may have broken one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31 in an incident may take a Post-Race Penalty at any time after the race until the beginning of a protest hearing involving the incident.\\n\\n (b) A Post-Race Penalty is a 30% Scoring Penalty calculated as stated in rule 44.3(c). However, rule 44.1(a) applies.\\n\\n (c) A boat takes a Post-Race Penalty by delivering to the arbitrator or a member of the protest committee a written statement that she accepts the penalty and that identifies the race number and where and when the incident occurred.\\n\\n T2 ARBITRATION MEETING\\n\\n An arbitration meeting will be held prior to a protest hearing for each incident resulting in a protest by a boat involving one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31, but only if each party is represented by a person who was on board at the time of the incident. No witnesses will be permitted. However, if the arbitrator decides that rule 44.1(b) may apply or that arbitration is not appropriate, the meeting will not be held, and if a meeting is in progress, it will be closed.\\n\\n 152\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n T3 ARBITRATOR’S OPINION\\n\\n Based on the evidence given by the representatives, the arbitrator will offer an opinion as to what the protest committee is likely to decide:\\n\\n (a) the protest is invalid,\\n\\n (b) no boat will be penalized for breaking a rule, or\\n\\n (c) one or more boats will be penalized for breaking a rule, identifying the boats and the penalties.\\n\\n T4 ARBITRATION MEETING OUTCOMES\\n\\n After the arbitrator offers an opinion,\\n\\n (a) a boat may take a Post-Race Penalty, and\\n\\n (b) a boat may ask to withdraw her protest. The arbitrator may then act on behalf of the protest committee in accordance with rule 63.2(a) to allow the withdrawal.\\n\\n Unless all protests involving the incident are withdrawn, a protest hearing will be held.\\n\\n 153\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nOfficial Partners\\n\\n\\nwww.sailing.org\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n\"]\n"

       "  '#### INTRODUCTION\\n\\n###### The Racing Rules of Sailing includes two main sections. The first, Parts 1–7, contains rules that affect all competitors. The second, the appendices, provides details of rules, rules that apply to particular kinds of racing, and rules that affect only a small number of competitors or officials.\\n\\n Terminology  A term used in the sense stated in the Definitions is printed in italics or, in preambles, in bold italics (for example, racing and racing).\\n\\n Each of the terms in the table below is used in The Racing Rules of Sailing with the meaning given.\\n\\n Term Meaning\\n Boat A sailboat and the crew on board.\\n Competitor A person who races or intends to race in the event.\\n National A World Sailing member national authority. authority\\n Race The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) committee and any other person or committee performing a\\n race committee function.\\n Racing rule A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.\\n Technical The technical committee appointed under rule committee 89.2(c) and any other person or committee\\n performing a technical committee function. \\n Vessel Any boat or ship.\\n\\n Other words and terms are used in the sense ordinarily understood in nautical or general use. \\n\\n Hails  A language other than English may be used for a hail required by the rules provided that it is reasonable for it to be understood by all boats affected. However, a hail in English is always acceptable.\\n\\n Notation  The notation ‘[DP]’ in a rule means that the penalty for a breach of the rule may, at the discretion of the protest committee, be less than disqualification. Guidelines for discretionary penalties are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n|Term|Meaning|\\n|---|---|\\n|Boat|A sailboat and the crew on board.|\\n|Competitor|A person who races or intends to race in the event.|\\n|National authority|A World Sailing member national authority.|\\n|Race committee|The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a race committee function.|\\n|Racing rule|A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.|\\n|Technical committee|The technical committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a technical committee function.|\\n|Vessel|Any boat or ship.|\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### Revision  The racing rules are revised and published every four years by World Sailing, the international authority for the sport. This edition becomes effective on 1 January 2021 except that for an event beginning in 2020 the date may be postponed by the notice of race or sailing instructions. Marginal markings indicate important changes to Parts 1–7 and the Definitions in the 2017–2020 edition. No changes are contemplated before 2025, but any changes determined to be urgent before then will be announced through national authorities and posted on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Appendices  When the rules of an appendix apply, they take precedence over any conflicting rules in Parts 1–7 and the Definitions. Each appendix is identified by a letter. A reference to a rule in an appendix will contain the letter and the rule number (for example, ‘rule A1’). The letters I, O and Q are not used to designate appendices in this book.\\n\\n World Sailing Regulations  The Regulations are referred to in the definition Rule and in rule 6, but they are not included in this book because they can be changed at any time. The most recent versions of the Regulations are published on the World Sailing website; new versions will be announced through national authorities.\\n\\n Interpretations  World Sailing publishes the following authoritative interpretations of the racing rules: \\n\\n • The Case Book – Interpretations of the Racing Rules,\\n\\n • The Call Books, for various disciplines,\\n\\n • Interpretations of Rule 42, Propulsion, and\\n\\n • Interpretations of the Regulations, for those Regulations that\\n are rules. \\n These publications are available on the World Sailing website. Other interpretations of the racing rules are not authoritative unless approved by World Sailing in accordance with Regulation 28.4. \\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '#### DEFINITIONS\\n\\n###### A term used as stated below is shown in italic type or, in preambles, in bold italic type. The meaning of several other terms is given in Terminology in the Introduction.\\n\\n Abandon  A race that a race committee or protest committee abandons is void but may be resailed.\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One boat is clear astern of another when her hull and equipment in normal position are behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other boat’s hull and equipment in normal position. The other boat is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a boat between them overlaps both. These terms always apply to boats on the same tack. They apply to boats on opposite tacks only when rule 18 applies between them or when both boats are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Conflict of Interest  A person has a conflict of interest if he\\n\\n (a) may gain or lose as a result of a decision to which he contributes,\\n\\n (b) may reasonably appear to have a personal or financial interest which could affect his ability to be impartial, or \\n\\n (c) has a close personal interest in a decision. \\n\\n Fetching A boat is fetching a mark when she is in a position to pass to windward of it and leave it on the required side without changing tack.\\n\\n Finish A boat finishes when, after starting, any part of her hull crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or \\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course. \\n\\n Keep Clear  A boat keeps clear of a right-of-way boat\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way boat can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and, \\n\\n (b) when the boats are overlapped, if the right-of-way boat can also change course in both directions without immediately making contact.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### Leeward and Windward  A boat’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her mainsail lies. The other side is her windward side. When two boats on the same tack overlap, the one on the leeward side of the other is the leeward boat. The other is the windward boat.\\n\\n Mark  An object the sailing instructions require a boat to leave on a specified side, a race committee vessel surrounded by navigable water from which the starting or finishing line extends, and an object intentionally attached to the object or vessel. However, an anchor line is not part of the mark. \\n\\n Mark-Room  Room for a boat to leave a mark on the required side. Also,\\n\\n (a) room to sail to the mark when her proper course is to sail close to it, and\\n\\n (b) room to round or pass the mark as necessary to sail the course without touching the mark. \\n\\n However, mark-room for a boat does not include room to tack unless she is overlapped inside and to windward of the boat required to give mark-room and she would be fetching the mark after her tack.\\n\\n Obstruction  An object that a boat could not pass without changing course substantially, if she were sailing directly towards it and one of her hull lengths from it. An object that can be safely passed on only one side and an object, area or line so designated by the sailing instructions are also obstructions. However, a boat racing is not an obstruction to other boats unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. A vessel under way, including a boat racing, is never a continuing obstruction.\\n\\n Overlap  See Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap.\\n\\n Party  A party to a hearing is\\n\\n (a) for a protest hearing: a protestor, a protestee;\\n\\n (b) for a redress hearing: a boat requesting redress or for which redress is requested; a boat for which a hearing is called to consider redress under rule 60.3(b); a race committee acting under rule 60.2(b); a technical committee acting under rule 60.4(b); \\n\\n (c) for a redress hearing under rule 62.1(a): the body alleged to have made an improper action or omission;',\n",
       "  ' (d) a person against whom an allegation of a breach of rule 69.1(a) is made; a person presenting an allegation under rule 69.2(e)(1); \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### (e) a support person subject to a hearing under rule 60.3(d) or 69; any boat that person supports; a person appointed to present an allegation under rule 60.3(d). \\n\\n However, the protest committee is never a party.\\n\\n Postpone  A postponed race is delayed before its scheduled start but may be started or abandoned later.\\n\\n Proper Course  A course a boat would choose in order to sail the course and finish as soon as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to in the rule using the term. A boat has no proper course before her starting signal.\\n\\n Protest  An allegation made under rule 61.2 by a boat, a race committee, a technical committee or a protest committee that a boat has broken a rule.\\n\\n Racing  A boat is racing from her preparatory signal until she finishes and clears the finishing line and marks or retires, or until the race committee signals a general recall, postponement or abandonment.\\n\\n Room  The space a boat needs in the existing conditions, including space to comply with her obligations under the rules of Part 2 and rule 31, while manoeuvring promptly in a seamanlike way.\\n\\n Rule\\n\\n (a) The rules in this book, including the Definitions, Race Signals, Introduction, preambles and the rules of relevant appendices, but not titles;\\n\\n (b) World Sailing Regulations that have been designated by World Sailing as having the status of a rule and are published on the World Sailing website; \\n\\n (c) the prescriptions of the national authority, unless they are changed by the notice of race or sailing instructions in compliance with the national authority’s prescription, if any, to rule 88.2; \\n\\n (d) the class rules (for a boat racing under a handicap or rating system, the rules of that system are ‘class rules’);\\n\\n (e) the notice of race;\\n\\n (f) the sailing instructions; and\\n\\n (g) any other documents that govern the event.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### Sail the Course A boat sails the course provided that a string representing her track from the time she begins to approach the starting line from its pre- start side to start until she finishes, when drawn taut,\\n\\n (a) passes each mark of the course for the race on the required side and in the correct order, \\n\\n (b) touches each mark designated in the sailing instructions to be a rounding mark, and \\n\\n (c) passes between the marks of a gate from the direction of the course from the previous mark. \\n\\n Start  A boat starts when, her hull having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, and having complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, any part of her hull crosses the starting line from the pre-start side to the course side. \\n\\n Support Person  Any person who\\n\\n (a) provides, or may provide, physical or advisory support to a competitor, including any coach, trainer, manager, team staff, medic, paramedic or any other person working with, treating or assisting a competitor in or preparing for the competition, or\\n\\n (b) is the parent or guardian of a competitor. \\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port  A boat is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to her windward side.\\n\\n Windward See Leeward and Windward.\\n\\n Zone  The area around a mark within a distance of three hull lengths of the boat nearer to it. A boat is in the zone when any part of her hull is in the zone.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### BASIC PRINCIPLES\\n\\n###### SPORTSMANSHIP AND THE RULES\\n\\n Competitors in the sport of sailing are governed by a body of rules that they are expected to follow and enforce. A fundamental principle of sportsmanship is that when a boat breaks a rule and is not exonerated she will promptly take an appropriate penalty or action, which may be to retire.\\n ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\n Participants are encouraged to minimize any adverse environmental impact of the sport of sailing.\\n PART 1',\n",
       "  '#### FUNDAMENTAL RULES\\n\\n###### 1 SAFETY\\n\\n 1.1 Helping Those in Danger\\n\\n A boat, competitor or support person shall give all possible help to any person or vessel in danger.\\n\\n 1.2 Life-Saving Equipment and Personal Flotation Devices\\n\\n A boat shall carry adequate life-saving equipment for all persons on board, including one item ready for immediate use, unless her class rules make some other provision. Each competitor is individually responsible for wearing a personal flotation device adequate for the conditions.\\n\\n 2 FAIR SAILING\\n\\n A boat and her owner shall compete in compliance with recognized principles of sportsmanship and fair play. A boat may be penalized under this rule only if it is clearly established that these principles have been violated. The penalty shall be a disqualification that is not excludable. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 3 DECISION TO RACE\\n\\n The responsibility for a boat’s decision to participate in a race or to continue racing is hers alone.\\n\\n 4 ACCEPTANCE OF THE RULES\\n\\n 4.1 (a) By participating or intending to participate in an event conducted under the rules, each competitor and boat owner agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n (b) A support person by providing support, or a parent or guardian by permitting their child to enter an event, agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n 4.2 Each competitor and boat owner agrees, on behalf of their support persons, that such support persons are bound by the rules.\\n\\n 4.3 Acceptance of the rules includes agreement\\n\\n (a) to be governed by the rules;\\n\\n (b) to accept the penalties imposed and other action taken under the rules, subject to the appeal and review procedures provided in them, as the final determination of any matter arising under the rules;\\n\\n (c) with respect to any such determination, not to resort to any court of law or tribunal not provided for in the rules; and\\n\\n (d) by each competitor and boat owner to ensure that their support persons are aware of the rules.\\n\\n 4.4 The person in charge of each boat shall ensure that all competitors in the crew and the boat’s owner are aware of their responsibilities under this rule.\\n\\n 4.5 This rule may be changed by a prescription of the national authority of the venue. \\n\\n 5 RULES GOVERNING ORGANIZING AUTHORITIES  AND OFFICIALS\\n\\n The organizing authority, race committee, technical committee, protest committee and other race officials shall be governed by the rules in the conduct and judging of the event.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### 6 WORLD SAILING REGULATIONS\\n\\n 6.1 Each competitor, boat owner and support person shall comply with the World Sailing Regulations that have been designated by World Sailing as having the status of a rule. These regulations as of 30 June 2020 are the World Sailing: \\n\\n ● Advertising Code\\n\\n ● Anti-Doping Code\\n\\n ● Betting and Anti-Corruption Code\\n\\n ● Disciplinary Code\\n\\n ● Eligibility Code\\n\\n ● Sailor Categorization Code \\n\\n 6.2 Rule 63.1 does not apply unless protests are permitted in the Regulation alleged to have been broken. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 2',\n",
       "  '#### WHEN BOATS MEET\\n\\n###### The rules of Part 2 apply between boats that are sailing in or near the racing area and intend to race, are racing, or have been racing. However, a boat not racing shall not be penalized for breaking one of these rules, except rule 14 when the incident resulted in injury or serious damage, or rule 23.1.\\n\\n When a boat sailing under these rules meets a vessel that is not, she shall comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS) or government right-of-way rules. If the notice of race so states, the rules of Part 2 are replaced by the right- of-way rules of the IRPCAS or by government right-of-way rules.\\n\\n SECTION A RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n A boat has right of way over another boat when the other boat is required to keep clear of her. However, some rules in Sections B, C and D limit the actions of a right-of-way boat.\\n\\n 10 ON OPPOSITE TACKS\\n\\n When boats are on opposite tacks, a port-tack boat shall keep clear of a starboard-tack boat.\\n\\n 11 ON THE SAME TACK, OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and overlapped, a windward boat shall keep clear of a leeward boat.\\n\\n 12 ON THE SAME TACK, NOT OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and not overlapped, a boat clear astern shall keep clear of a boat clear ahead.\\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n After a boat passes head to wind, she shall keep clear of other boats until she is on a close-hauled course. During that time rules 10, 11 and\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### 12 do not apply. If two boats are subject to this rule at the same time, the one on the other’s port side or the one astern shall keep clear.\\n\\n SECTION B GENERAL LIMITATIONS\\n\\n 14 AVOIDING CONTACT\\n\\n A boat shall avoid contact with another boat if reasonably possible. However, a right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark- room to which she is entitled, need not act to avoid contact until it is clear that the other boat is not keeping clear or giving room or mark- room. \\n\\n 15 ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n When a boat acquires right of way, she shall initially give the other boat room to keep clear, unless she acquires right of way because of the other boat’s actions.\\n\\n 16 CHANGING COURSE\\n\\n 16.1 When a right-of-way boat changes course, she shall give the other boat room to keep clear.\\n\\n 16.2 In addition, on a beat to windward when a port-tack boat is keeping clear by sailing to pass to leeward of a starboard-tack boat, the starboard-tack boat shall not bear away if as a result the port-tack boat must change course immediately to continue keeping clear. \\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK; PROPER COURSE\\n\\n If a boat clear astern becomes overlapped within two of her hull lengths to leeward of a boat on the same tack, she shall not sail above her proper course while they remain on the same tack and overlapped within that distance, unless in doing so she promptly sails astern of the other boat. This rule does not apply if the overlap begins while the windward boat is required by rule 13 to keep clear.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### SECTION C AT MARKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n Section C rules do not apply at a starting mark surrounded by navigable water or at its anchor line from the time boats are approaching them to start until they have passed them.\\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n 18.1 When Rule 18 Applies\\n\\n Rule 18 applies between boats when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is in the zone. However, it does not apply\\n\\n (a) between boats on opposite tacks on a beat to windward,\\n\\n (b) between boats on opposite tacks when the proper course at the mark for one but not both of them is to tack,\\n\\n (c) between a boat approaching a mark and one leaving it, or\\n\\n (d) if the mark is a continuing obstruction, in which case rule 19 applies.\\n\\n Rule 18 no longer applies between boats when mark-room has been given. \\n\\n 18.2 Giving Mark-Room\\n\\n (a) When boats are overlapped the outside boat shall give the inside boat mark-room, unless rule 18.2(b) applies.\\n\\n (b) If boats are overlapped when the first of them reaches the zone, the outside boat at that moment shall thereafter give the inside boat mark-room. If a boat is clear ahead when she reaches the zone, the boat clear astern at that moment shall thereafter give her mark-room.\\n\\n (c) When a boat is required to give mark-room by rule 18.2(b),\\n\\n (1) she shall continue to do so even if later an overlap is broken or a new overlap begins;\\n\\n (2) if she becomes overlapped inside the boat entitled to mark- room, she shall also give that boat room to sail her proper course while they remain overlapped.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### (d) Rules 18.2(b) and (c) cease to apply if the boat entitled to mark- room passes head to wind or leaves the zone. \\n\\n (e) If there is reasonable doubt that a boat obtained or broke an overlap in time, it shall be presumed that she did not.\\n\\n (f) If a boat obtained an inside overlap from clear astern or by tacking to windward of the other boat and, from the time the overlap began, the outside boat has been unable to give mark- room, she is not required to give it.\\n\\n 18.3 Passing Head to Wind in the Zone\\n\\n If a boat in the zone of a mark to be left to port passes head to wind from port to starboard tack and is then fetching the mark, she shall not cause a boat that has been on starboard tack since entering the zone to sail above close-hauled to avoid contact and she shall give mark-room if that boat becomes overlapped inside her. When this rule applies between boats, rule 18.2 does not apply between them. \\n\\n 18.4 Gybing\\n\\n When an inside overlapped right-of-way boat must gybe at a mark to sail her proper course, until she gybes she shall sail no farther from the mark than needed to sail that course. Rule 18.4 does not apply at a gate mark.\\n\\n 19 ROOM TO PASS AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n 19.1 When Rule 19 Applies\\n\\n Rule 19 applies between two boats at an obstruction except \\n\\n (a) when the obstruction is a mark the boats are required to leave on the same side, or\\n\\n (b) when rule 18 applies between the boats and the obstruction is another boat overlapped with each of them. \\n\\n However, at a continuing obstruction, rule 19 always applies and rule 18 does not.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### 19.2 Giving Room at an Obstruction\\n\\n (a) A right-of-way boat may choose to pass an obstruction on either side.\\n\\n (b) When boats are overlapped, the outside boat shall give the inside boat room between her and the obstruction, unless she has been unable to do so from the time the overlap began.\\n\\n (c) While boats are passing a continuing obstruction, if a boat that was clear astern and required to keep clear becomes overlapped between the other boat and the obstruction and, at the moment the overlap begins, there is not room for her to pass between them, \\n\\n (1) she is not entitled to room under rule 19.2(b), and\\n\\n (2) while the boats remain overlapped, she shall keep clear and rules 10 and 11 do not apply. \\n\\n 20 ROOM TO TACK AT AN OBSTRUCTION\\n\\n 20.1 Hailing\\n\\n A boat may hail for room to tack and avoid a boat on the same tack. However, she shall not hail unless\\n\\n (a) she is approaching an obstruction and will soon need to make a substantial course change to avoid it safely, and\\n\\n (b) she is sailing close-hauled or above.\\n\\n In addition, she shall not hail if the obstruction is a mark and a boat that is fetching it would be required to change course as a result of the hail.\\n\\n 20.2 Responding\\n\\n (a) After a boat hails, she shall give a hailed boat time to respond.\\n\\n (b) A hailed boat shall respond even if the hail breaks rule 20.1.\\n\\n (c) A hailed boat shall respond either by tacking as soon as possible, or by immediately replying ‘You tack’ and then giving the hailing boat room to tack and avoid her.\\n\\n (d) When a hailed boat responds, the hailing boat shall tack as soon as possible.\\n\\n (e) From the time a boat hails until she has tacked and avoided a hailed boat, rule 18.2 does not apply between them.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### 20.3 Passing On a Hail to an Additional Boat\\n\\n When a boat has been hailed for room to tack and she intends to respond by tacking, she may hail another boat on the same tack for room to tack and avoid her. She may hail even if her hail does not meet the conditions of rule 20.1. Rule 20.2 applies between her and a boat she hails. \\n\\n 20.4 Additional Requirements for Hails\\n\\n (a) When conditions are such that a hail may not be heard, the boat shall also make a signal that clearly indicates her need for room to tack or her response.\\n\\n (b) The notice of race may specify an alternative communication for a boat to indicate her need for room to tack or her response, and require boats to use it. \\n\\n SECTION D  OTHER RULES\\n\\n When rule 21 or 22 applies between two boats, Section A rules do not.\\n\\n 21 STARTING ERRORS; TAKING PENALTIES;  BACKING A SAIL \\n\\n 21.1 A boat sailing towards the pre-start side of the starting line or one of its extensions after her starting signal to start or to comply with rule 30.1 shall keep clear of a boat not doing so until her hull is completely on the pre-start side.\\n\\n 21.2 A boat taking a penalty shall keep clear of one that is not.\\n\\n 21.3 A boat moving astern, or sideways to windward, through the water by backing a sail shall keep clear of one that is not.\\n\\n 22 CAPSIZED, ANCHORED OR AGROUND; RESCUING\\n\\n If possible, a boat shall avoid a boat that is capsized or has not regained control after capsizing, is anchored or aground, or is trying to help a person or vessel in danger. A boat is capsized when her masthead is in the water.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### 23 INTERFERING WITH ANOTHER BOAT\\n\\n 23.1 If reasonably possible, a boat not racing shall not interfere with a boat that is racing.\\n\\n 23.2 If reasonably possible, a boat shall not interfere with a boat that is taking a penalty, sailing on another leg or subject to rule 21.1. However, after the starting signal this rule does not apply when the boat is sailing her proper course. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### PART 3',\n",

The sailing instructions shall be made available to each boat before a race begins. \\n\\n 25.2 The meanings of the visual and sound signals stated in Race Signals shall not be changed except under rule 86.1(b). The meanings of any other signals that may be used shall be stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions. \\n\\n 25.3 When the race committee is required to display a flag as a visual signal, it may use a flag or other object of a similar appearance. \\n\\n 26 STARTING RACES\\n\\n Races shall be started by using the following signals.

If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall receive, without a hearing, a 20% Scoring Penalty calculated as stated in rule 44.3(c). She shall be penalized even if the race is restarted or resailed, but not if it is postponed or abandoned before the starting signal. If she is similarly identified during a subsequent attempt to start the same race, she shall receive an additional 20% Scoring Penalty.\\n\\n 30.3 U Flag Rule\\n\\n If flag U has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall be disqualified without a hearing, but not if the race is restarted or resailed. \\n\\n 30.4 Black Flag Rule\\n\\n If a black flag has been displayed, no part of a boat’s hull shall be in the triangle formed by the ends of the starting line and the first mark during the last minute before her starting signal. If a boat breaks this rule and is identified, she shall be disqualified without a hearing, even if the race is restarted or resailed, but not if it is postponed or abandoned before the starting signal. If a general recall is signalled or the race is abandoned after the starting signal, the race committee shall display her sail number before the next warning signal for that race, and if the race is restarted or resailed she shall not sail in it. If she does so, her disqualification shall not be excluded in calculating her series score.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

However, after one boat has started, sailed the course and finished within the race time limit, if any, the race committee shall not abandon the race without considering the consequences for all boats in the race or series. \\n\\n 32.2 If the race committee signals a shortened course (displays flag S with two sounds), the finishing line shall be,\\n\\n (a) at a rounding mark, between the mark and a staff displaying flag S;\\n\\n (b) a line the course requires boats to cross; or \\n\\n (c) at a gate, between the gate marks.\\n\\n The shortened course shall be signalled before the first boat crosses the finishing line.\\n\\n 33 CHANGING THE NEXT LEG OF THE COURSE \\n\\n While boats are racing, the race committee may change a leg of the course that begins at a rounding mark or at a gate by changing the position of the next mark (or the finishing line) and signalling all boats before they begin the leg. The next mark need not be in position at that time.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

This action is not permitted if it clearly propels the boat.\\n\\n (f) A boat may reduce speed by repeatedly moving her helm.\\n\\n (g) Any means of propulsion may be used to help a person or another vessel in danger.\\n\\n (h) To get clear after grounding or colliding with a vessel or object, a boat may use force applied by her crew or the crew of the other vessel and any equipment other than a propulsion engine. However, the use of an engine may be permitted by rule 42.3(i).\\n\\n (i) Sailing instructions may, in stated circumstances, permit propulsion using an engine or any other method, provided the boat does not gain a significant advantage in the race.\\n\\n Note: Interpretations of rule 42 are available at the World Sailing website or by mail upon request.\\n\\n 43 EXONERATION \\n\\n 43.1 (a) When as a consequence of breaking a rule a boat has compelled another boat to break a rule, the other boat is exonerated for her breach.\\n\\n (b) When a boat is sailing within the room or mark-room to which she is entitled and, as a consequence of an incident with a boat required to give her that room or mark-room she breaks a rule of Section A of Part 2, rule 15, 16, or 31, she is exonerated for her breach. \\n\\n (c) A right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark- room to which she is entitled, is exonerated for breaking rule 14 if the contact does not cause damage or injury.\\n\\n 43.2 A boat exonerated for breaking a rule need not take a penalty and shall not be penalized for breaking that rule. \\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

She may take a One-Turn Penalty when she may have broken rule 31. Alternatively, the notice of race or sailing instructions may specify the use of the Scoring Penalty or some other penalty, in which case the specified penalty shall replace the One-Turn and the Two-Turns Penalty. However,\\n\\n (a) when a boat may have broken a rule of Part 2 and rule 31 in the same incident she need not take the penalty for breaking rule 31;\\n\\n (b) if the boat caused injury or serious damage or, despite taking a penalty, gained a significant advantage in the race or series by her breach her penalty shall be to retire.\\n\\n 44.2 One-Turn and Two-Turns Penalties\\n\\n After getting well clear of other boats as soon after the incident as possible, a boat takes a One-Turn or Two-Turns Penalty by promptly making the required number of turns in the same direction, each turn including one tack and one gybe. When a boat takes the penalty at or near the finishing line, her hull shall be completely on the course side of the line before she finishes.\\n\\n 44.3 Scoring Penalty \\n\\n (a) A boat takes a Scoring Penalty by displaying a yellow flag at the first reasonable opportunity after the incident.\\n\\n (b) When a boat has taken a Scoring Penalty, she shall keep the yellow flag displayed until finishing and call the race committee’s attention to it at the finishing line. At that time she shall also inform the race committee of the identity of the other boat involved in the incident. If this is impracticable, she shall do so at the first reasonable opportunity and within the protest time limit. \\n\\n (c) The race score for a boat that takes a Scoring Penalty shall be the score she would have received without that penalty, made worse by the number of places stated in the notice of race or sailing instructions. When the number of places is not stated, the penalty shall be 20% of the score for Did Not Finish, rounded to the nearest whole number (0.5 rounded upward). The scores of\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

However, the penalty shall not cause the boat’s score to be worse than the score for Did Not Finish. \\n\\n 45 HAULING OUT; MAKING FAST; ANCHORING \\n\\n A boat shall be afloat and off moorings at her preparatory signal. Thereafter, she shall not be hauled out or made fast except to bail out, reef sails or make repairs. She may anchor or the crew may stand on the bottom. She shall recover the anchor before continuing in the race unless she is unable to do so.\\n\\n 46 PERSON IN CHARGE\\n\\n A boat shall have on board a person in charge designated by the member or organization that entered the boat. See rule 75.\\n\\n 47 TRASH DISPOSAL \\n\\n Competitors and support persons shall not intentionally put trash in the water. This rule applies at all times while afloat. The penalty for a breach of this rule may be less than disqualification. \\n\\n SECTION B EQUIPMENT-RELATED REQUIREMENTS \\n\\n 48 L IMITATIONS ON EQUIPMENT AND CREW\\n\\n 48.1 A boat shall use only the equipment on board at her preparatory signal.\\n\\n 48.2 No person on board shall intentionally leave, except when ill or injured, or to help a person or vessel in danger, or to swim.

A decision on redress shall not be made without a hearing. The protest committee shall hear all protests and requests for redress that have been delivered to the race office unless it allows a protest or request to be withdrawn.\\n\\n 63.2 Time and Place of the Hearing; Time for Parties to Prepare\\n\\n All parties to the hearing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing, the protest or redress information or the allegations shall be made available to them, and they shall be allowed reasonable time to prepare for the hearing. When two or more hearings arise from the same incident, or from very closely connected incidents, they may be heard together in one hearing.

If the protest has been made under rule 60.3(a)(1), the committee shall also determine whether or not injury or serious damage resulted from the incident in question. If not, the hearing shall be closed. \\n\\n 63.6 Taking Evidence and Finding Facts\\n\\n (a) The protest committee shall take the evidence, including hearsay evidence, of the parties present at the hearing and of their witnesses and other evidence it considers necessary.

These are available at the World Sailing website.\\n\\n CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS\\n\\n The definitions Mark-Room, and Tack, Starboard or Port are changed to:\\n\\n Mark-Room Mark-Room for a board is room to sail her proper course to round or pass the mark. However, mark-room for a board does not include room to tack unless she is overlapped inside and to windward of the board required to give mark-room and she would be fetching the mark after her tack.\\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port  A board is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to the competitor’s hand that would be nearer the mast if the competitor were in normal sailing position with both hands on the wishbone and arms not crossed. A board is on starboard tack when the competitor’s right hand would be nearer the mast and is on port tack when the competitor’s left hand would be nearer the mast. \\n\\n The definition Zone is deleted. \\n\\n Add the following definitions:\\n\\n Capsized  A board is capsized when she is not under control because her sail or the competitor is in the water. \\n\\n Rounding or Passing  A board is rounding or passing a mark from the time her proper course is to begin to manoeuvre to round or pass it, until the mark has been rounded or passed. \\n\\n B1 CHANGES TO THE RULES OF PART 1\\n\\n [No changes.]\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

       "  '#### KITEBOARDING RACING RULES \\n\\n###### Kiteboarding course races shall be sailed under The Racing Rules of Sailing as changed by this appendix. The term ‘boat’ elsewhere in the racing rules means ‘kiteboard’ or ‘boat’ as appropriate. \\n\\n Note: Rules for other kiteboarding racing formats (such as Short Track, Kitecross, Slalom, Boarder X) or other kiteboarding competitions (such as Freestyle, Wave, Big Air, Speed) are not included in this appendix. Links to current versions of these rules can be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS\\n\\n The definitions Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap, Finish, Keep Clear, Leeward and Windward, Mark-Room, Obstruction, Start, Tack, Starboard or Port and Zone are changed to:\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One kiteboard is clear astern of another when her hull is behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other kiteboard’s hull. The other kiteboard is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a kiteboard between them overlaps both. If there is reasonable doubt that two kiteboards are overlapped, it shall be presumed that they are not. These terms always apply to kiteboards on the same tack. They apply to kiteboards on opposite tacks only when both kiteboards are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind. \\n\\n Finish A kiteboard finishes when, after starting, while the competitor is in contact with the hull, any part of her hull, or the competitor, crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she \\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2, \\n\\n (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or \\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp',\n",
       "  '###### Keep Clear  A kiteboard keeps clear of a right-of-way kiteboard\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way kiteboard can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and, \\n\\n (b) when the kiteboards are overlapped, if the right-of-way kiteboard can also change course in both directions or move her kite in any direction without immediately making contact.\\n\\n Leeward and Windward  A kiteboard’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her kite lies. The other side is her windward side. When two kiteboards on the same tack overlap, the one whose hull is on the leeward side of the other’s hull is the leeward kiteboard. The other is the windward kiteboard.\\n\\n Mark-Room  Room for a kiteboard to sail her proper course to round or pass the mark on the required side. \\n\\n Obstruction  An object that a kiteboard could not pass without substantially changing her course or the position of her kite, if she were sailing directly towards it and 10 metres from it. An object that can be safely passed on only one side and an object, area or line so designated by the sailing instructions are also obstructions. However, a kiteboard racing is not an obstruction to other kiteboards unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. A vessel under way, including a kiteboard racing, is never a continuing obstruction. \\n\\n Start  A kiteboard starts when, her hull and the competitor having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, and having complied with rule 30.1 if it applies, any part of her hull or the competitor crosses the starting line from the pre- start side to the course side.\\n\\n Tack, Starboard or Port  A kiteboard is on the tack, starboard or port, corresponding to the competitor’s hand that would be forward if the competitor were in normal riding position (riding heel side with both hands on the control bar and arms not crossed). A kiteboard is on starboard tack when the competitor’s right hand would be forward and is on the port tack when the competitor’s left hand would be forward. \\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

       "  '#### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  PROTEST COMMITTEES\\n\\n###### This appendix is advisory only; in some circumstances changing these procedures may be advisable. It is addressed primarily to protest committee chairmen but may also help judges, protest committee secretaries, race committees and others connected with protest and redress hearings.\\n\\n In a protest or redress hearing, the protest committee should weigh all testimony with equal care; should recognize that honest testimony can vary, and even be in conflict, as a result of different observations and recollections; should resolve such differences as best it can; should recognize that no boat or competitor is guilty until a breach of a rule has been established to the satisfaction of the protest committee; and should keep an open mind until all the evidence has been heard as to whether a boat or competitor has broken a rule.\\n\\n M1 PRELIMINARIES (may be performed by race office staff)\\n\\n ● Receive the protest or request for redress.\\n\\n ● Note on the form the time the protest or request is delivered and the protest time limit.\\n\\n ● Inform each party, and the race committee when necessary, when and where the hearing will be held.\\n\\n M2 BEFORE THE HEARING\\n\\n M2.1 Make sure that\\n\\n ● each party has a copy of or the opportunity to read the protest, request for redress or allegation and has had reasonable time to prepare for the hearing. \\n\\n ● only one person from each boat (or party) is present unless an interpreter is needed.\\n\\n ● all boats and people involved are represented. If they are not, however, the committee may proceed under rule 63.3(b).\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n ● boats’ representatives were on board when required (rule 63.3(a)). When the parties were in different events, both organizing authorities must accept the composition of the protest committee (rule 63.8). In a protest concerning class rules, obtain the current class rules and identify the authority responsible for interpreting them (rule 64.4(b)). \\n\\n M2.2 Determine if any members of the protest committee saw the incident. If so, require each of them to state that fact in the presence of the parties (rule 63.6(b)). \\n\\n M2.3 Assess conflicts of interest.\\n\\n ● Ensure that all protest committee members declare any possible conflicts of interest. At major events this will often be a formal written declaration made before the event starts that will be kept with the protest committee records.\\n\\n ● At the start of any hearing, ensure that the parties are aware of any conflicts of interest of protest committee members. Ask the parties if they consent to the members. If a party does not object as soon as possible after a conflict of interest has been declared, the protest committee may take this as consent to proceed and should record it.\\n\\n ● If a party objects to a member, the remainder of the protest committee members need to assess whether the conflict of interest is significant. The assessment will consider the level of the event, the level of the conflict and the perception of fairness. It may be acceptable to balance conflicts between protest committee members. Guidance may be found on the World Sailing website. Record the decision and the grounds for that decision.\\n\\n ● In cases of doubt it may be preferable to proceed with a smaller protest committee. Except for hearings under rule 69, there is no minimum number of protest committee members required.\\n\\n ● When a request for redress is made under rule 62.1(a) and is based on an improper action or omission of a body other than the protest committee, a member of that body should not be a member of the protest committee. \\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n M3 THE HEARING\\n\\n M3.1 Check the validity of the protest or request for redress.\\n\\n ● Are the contents adequate (rule 61.2 or 62)?\\n\\n ● Was it delivered in time? If not, is there good reason to extend the time limit (rule 61.3 or 62.2)?\\n\\n ● When required, was the protestor involved in or a witness to the incident (rule 60.1(a))?\\n\\n ● When necessary, was ‘Protest’ hailed and, if required, a red flag displayed correctly (rule 61.1(a))?\\n\\n ● When the flag or hail was not necessary, was the protestee informed?\\n\\n ● Decide whether the protest or request for redress is valid (rule 63.5).\\n\\n ● Once the validity of the protest or request has been determined, do not let the subject be introduced again unless truly new evidence is available.\\n\\n M3.2 Take the evidence (rule 63.6).\\n\\n ● Ask the protestor and then the protestee to tell their stories. Then allow them to question one another. In a redress matter, ask the party to state the request.\\n\\n ● Make sure you know what facts each party is alleging before calling any witnesses. Their stories may be different.\\n\\n ● Allow anyone, including a boat’s crew, to give evidence. It is the party who normally decides which witnesses to call, although the protest committee may also call witnesses (rule 63.6(a)). The question asked by a party ‘Would you like to hear N?’ is best answered by ‘It is your choice.’\\n\\n ● Call each party’s witnesses (and the protest committee’s if any) one by one. Limit parties to questioning the witness(es). (They may wander into general statements.)\\n\\n ● Invite the protestee to question the protestor’s witness first (and vice versa). This prevents the protestor from leading his witness from the beginning.\\n\\n ● Allow members of the protest committee who saw the incident to give evidence (rule 63.6(b)), but only while the parties are\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

Members who give evidence may be questioned, should take care to relate all they know about the incident that could affect the decision, and may remain on the protest committee (rule 63.3(a)).\\n\\n ● Try to prevent leading questions, but if that is impossible discount the evidence so obtained. \\n\\n ● The protest committee chairman should advise a party or a witness giving hearsay, repetitive or irrelevant evidence that the protest committee must give such evidence appropriate weight, which may be little or no weight at all. \\n\\n ● Accept written evidence from a witness who is not available to be questioned only if all parties agree. In doing so they forego their rights to question that witness (rule 63.6(c)). \\n\\n ● Ask one member of the committee to note down evidence, particularly times, distances, speeds, etc.\\n\\n ● Invite questions from protest committee members. \\n\\n ● Invite first the protestor and then the protestee to make a final statement of her case, particularly on any application or interpretation of the rules.\\n\\n M3.3 Find the facts (rule 63.6(d)). \\n\\n ● Write down the facts; resolve doubts one way or the other.\\n\\n ● Call back parties for more questions if necessary.\\n\\n ● When appropriate, draw a diagram of the incident using the facts you have found.\\n\\n M3.4 Decide the case (rule 64).\\n\\n ● Base the decision on the facts found. (If you cannot, find some more facts.)\\n\\n ● In redress cases, make sure that no further evidence is needed from boats that will be affected by the decision.\\n\\n M3.5 Inform the parties (rule 65).\\n\\n ● Recall the parties and read them the facts found, conclusions and rules that apply, and the decision. When time presses it is permissible to read the decision and give the details later.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n ● Give any party a copy of the decision on request. File the protest or request for redress with the committee records.\\n\\n M4 REOPENING A HEARING (rule 66)\\n\\n M4.1 When a party, within the time limit, has asked for a hearing to be reopened, hear the party making the request, look at any video, etc., and decide whether there is any significant new evidence that might lead you to change your decision. Decide whether your interpretation of the rules may have been wrong; be open-minded as to whether you have made a mistake. If none of these applies refuse to reopen; otherwise schedule a hearing.\\n\\n M4.2 Evidence is ‘new’\\n\\n ● if it was not reasonably possible for the party asking for the reopening to have discovered the evidence before the original hearing,\\n\\n ● if the protest committee is satisfied that before the original hearing the evidence was diligently but unsuccessfully sought by the party asking for the reopening, or\\n\\n ● if the protest committee learns from any source that the evidence was not available to the parties at the time of the original hearing.\\n\\n M5 MISCONDUCT (rule 69) \\n\\n M5.1 An action under this rule is not a protest, but the protest committee gives its allegations in writing to the competitor before the hearing. The hearing is conducted under rules similar to those governing a protest hearing but the protest committee must have at least three members (rule 69.2(a)). Use the greatest care to protect the competitor’s rights.\\n\\n M5.2 A competitor or a boat cannot protest under rule 69, but the hearing request form of a competitor who tries to do so may be accepted as a report to the protest committee, which can then decide whether or not to call a hearing.\\n\\n M5.3 Unless World Sailing has appointed a person for the role, the protest committee may appoint a person to present the allegation. This person might be a race official, the person making the allegation or other appropriate person. When no reasonable alternative person is\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n available, a person who was appointed as a member of the protest committee may present the allegation.\\n\\n M5.4 When it is desirable to call a hearing under rule 69 as a result of a Part 2 incident, it is important to hear any boat-vs.-boat protest in the normal way, deciding which boat, if any, broke which rule, before proceeding against the competitor under rule 69.\\n\\n M5.5 Although action under rule 69 is taken against a competitor, boat owner or support person, and not a boat, a boat may also be penalized (rules 69.2(h)(2) and 64.5).\\n\\n M5.6 When a protest committee upholds a rule 69 allegation it will need to consider if it is appropriate to report to either a national authority or World Sailing. Guidance on when to report may be found in the World Sailing Case Book. When the protest committee does make a report it may recommend whether or not further action should be taken.\\n\\n M5.7 Unless the right of appeal is denied in accordance with rule 70.5, a party to a rule 69 hearing may appeal the decision of the protest committee.\\n\\n M5.8 Further guidance for protest committees about misconduct may be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n M6 APPEALS (rule 70 and Appendix R)\\n\\n When decisions can be appealed,\\n\\n ● retain the papers relevant to the hearing so that the information can easily be used for an appeal. Is there a diagram endorsed or prepared by the protest committee? Are the facts found sufficient? (Example: Was there an overlap? Yes or No. ‘Perhaps’ is not a fact found.) Are the names of the protest committee members and other important information on the form?\\n\\n ● comments by the protest committee on any appeal should enable the appeals committee to picture the whole incident clearly; the appeals committee knows nothing about the situation.\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n M7 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE\\n\\n Photographs and videos can sometimes provide useful evidence but protest committees should recognize their limitations and note the following points:\\n\\n ● The party producing the photographic evidence is responsible for arranging the viewing.\\n\\n ● View the video several times to extract all the information from it.\\n\\n ● The depth perception of any single-lens camera is very poor; with a telephoto lens it is non-existent. When the camera views two overlapped boats at right angles to their course, it is impossible to assess the distance between them. When the camera views them head on, it is impossible to see whether an overlap exists unless it is substantial.\\n\\n ● Ask the following questions:\\n\\n • Where was the camera in relation to the boats?\\n\\n • Was the camera’s platform moving? If so in what direction and how fast?\\n\\n • Is the angle changing as the boats approach the critical point? Fast panning causes radical change.\\n\\n • Did the camera have an unrestricted view throughout?\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX N',\n",

It shall be independent of and have no members from the race committee or the technical committee, and it shall be appointed by the organizing authority, subject to approval by the national authority if required (see rule 91(b)), or by World Sailing under rule 89.2(c).\\n\\n N1.2 The jury shall consist of a chairman, a vice chairman if desired, and other members for a total of at least five. A majority shall be International Judges. \\n\\n N1.3 No more than two members (three, in Groups M, N and Q) shall be from the same national authority.\\n\\n N1.4 (a) The chairman of a jury may appoint one or more panels composed in compliance with rules N1.1, N1.2 and N1.3. This can be done even if the full jury is not composed in compliance with these rules.\\n\\n (b) The chairman of a jury may appoint panels of at least three members each, of which the majority shall be International Judges. Members of each panel shall be from at least three different national authorities except in Groups M, N and Q, where they shall be from at least two different national authorities. If dissatisfied with a panel’s decision, a party is entitled to a hearing by a panel composed in compliance with rules N1.1, N1.2 and N1.3, except concerning the facts found, if requested within 30 minutes or the time limit specified in the sailing instructions.\\n\\n N1.5 When a full jury, or a panel, has fewer than five members, because of illness or emergency, and no qualified replacements are available, it remains properly constituted if it consists of at least three members and if at least two of them are International Judges.

All members shall be International Judges. The members shall be from three different national authorities (two, in Groups M, N and Q). The authorization shall be stated in a letter of approval to the organizing authority and in the notice of race or sailing instructions, and the letter shall be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n N1.8 When the national authority’s approval is required for the appointment of an international jury (see rule 91(b)), notice of its approval shall be included in the sailing instructions or be posted on the official notice board.\\n\\n N1.9 If the jury or a panel acts while not properly constituted, its decisions may be appealed.\\n\\n N2 RESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\n N2.1 An international jury is responsible for hearing and deciding all protests, requests for redress and other matters arising under the rules of Part 5. When asked by the organizing authority, the race committee or the technical committee, it shall advise and assist them on any matter directly affecting the fairness of the competition.\\n\\n N2.2 Unless the organizing authority directs otherwise, the jury shall decide\\n\\n (a) questions of eligibility, measurement or rating certificates; and \\n\\n (b) whether to authorize the substitution of competitors, boats or equipment when a rule requires such a decision.\\n\\n N2.3 The jury shall also decide matters referred to it by the organizing authority, the race committee or the technical committee. \\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

When otherwise considering a significant conflict of interest as required by rule 63.4, considerable weight must be given to the fact that decisions of an international jury cannot be appealed and this may affect the perception of fairness and lower the level of conflict that is significant. In case of doubt, the hearing should proceed as permitted by rule N1.6. \\n\\n N3.2 If a panel fails to agree on a decision it may adjourn, in which case the chairman shall refer the matter to a properly constituted panel with as many members as possible, which may be the full jury.\\n\\n N4 MISCONDUCT (Rule 69) \\n\\n N4.1 The World Sailing Disciplinary Code contains procedures that apply to specific international events with regard to the appointment of a person to conduct any investigation. These procedures override any conflicting provision of this appendix. \\n\\n N4.2 A person shall be responsible for presenting to the hearing panel any allegations of misconduct under rule 69. This person shall not be a member of the hearing panel but may be a member of the jury. Such a person shall be required to make full disclosure of all material that may come into his possession in the course of his investigation to the person subject to allegations of a breach of rule 69. \\n\\n N4.3 Prior to a hearing, the hearing panel, to the extent practically possible, shall not act as an investigator of any allegations made under rule 69. However, during the hearing the panel shall be entitled to ask any investigative questions it may see fit. \\n\\n N4.4 If the panel decides to call a hearing, all material disclosed to the panel in order for them to make that decision must be disclosed to the person subject to the allegations before the hearing begins. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### APPENDIX P',\n",

The second, the appendices, provides details of rules, rules that apply to particular kinds of racing, and rules that affect only a small number of competitors or officials.\\n\\n Terminology  A term used in the sense stated in the Definitions is printed in italics or, in preambles, in bold italics (for example, racing and racing).\\n Each of the terms in the table below is used in The Racing Rules of Sailing with the meaning given.\\n\\n Term Meaning\\n Boat A sailboat and the crew on board, that are subject to the rules. \\n Competitor A person who races or intends to race in the event.\\n National A World Sailing member national authority. authority\\n Race The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) committee and any other person or committee performing a\\n race committee function.\\n Racing rule A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.\\n Technical The technical committee appointed under rule committee 89.2(c) and any other person or committee\\n performing a technical committee function. \\n Vessel Any boat or ship.\\n\\n Other words and terms are used in the sense ordinarily understood in nautical or general use. For a source of the nautical sense of a word, a reader may refer to The Equipment Rules of Sailing.\\n\\n Hails  A language other than English may be used for a hail required by the rules provided that it is reasonable for it to be understood by all boats affected. However, a hail in English is always acceptable.\\n\\n Notation  The notation ‘[DP]’ in a rule means that the penalty for a breach of the rule may, at the discretion of the protest committee, be\\n\\n 5\\n\\n|Sailing with the m|meaning given.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Term|Meaning|\\n|Boat|A sailboat and the crew on board, that are subject to the rules.|\\n|Competitor|A person who races or intends to race in the event.|\\n|National authority|A World Sailing member national authority.|\\n|Race committee|The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a race committee function.|\\n|Racing rule|A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.|\\n|Technical committee|The technical committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a technical committee function.|\\n|Vessel|Any boat or ship.|\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

Guidelines for discretionary penalties are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Revision  The racing rules are revised and published every four years by World Sailing, the international authority for the sport. This edition becomes effective on 1 January 2025 except that for an event beginning in 2024 the date may be postponed by the notice of race. Marginal markings indicate important changes to Parts 1–7 and the Definitions in the 2021–2024 edition. No changes are contemplated before 2029, but any changes determined to be urgent before then will be announced through national authorities and posted on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Appendices  When the rules of an appendix apply, they take precedence over any conflicting rules in Parts 1–7 and the Definitions. Each appendix in this book is identified by a letter. Other appendices are available on the World Sailing website and are identified by two or three letters. A reference to a rule in an appendix will contain the letter or letters, and the rule number (for example, ‘rule A1’ or ‘rule MR1’). The letters I, K, L, O and Q are not used to designate appendices in this book. \\n\\n Development Rules  Development Rules may be approved by World Sailing for specific events or categories of events. They are available on the World Sailing website and are identified by the letters DR. \\n\\n Notice of Race and Sailing Instructions  Guides and templates for writing a notice of race and sailing instructions are available, in various file formats, on the World Sailing website at\\n www.sailing.org/racingrules. National authorities are encouraged to translate these guides and templates. \\n\\n World Sailing Regulations  The Regulations are referred to in the definition Rule and in rule 6, but they are not included in this book because they can be changed at any time. The most recent versions of the Regulations are published on the World Sailing website; new versions will be announced through national authorities.\\n\\n\\n###### 6\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Interpretations  World Sailing publishes the following authoritative interpretations of the racing rules:\\n\\n • The Case Book – Interpretations of the Racing Rules,\\n\\n • The Call Books, for various disciplines,\\n\\n • Interpretations of Rule 42, Propulsion, and\\n\\n • Interpretations of the Regulations, for those Regulations that\\n are rules.\\n These publications are available on the World Sailing website. Other interpretations of the racing rules are not authoritative unless approved by World Sailing. \\n\\n 7\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '### DEFINITIONS\\n\\n###### A term used as stated below is shown in italic type or, in preambles, in bold italic type. The meaning of several other terms is given in Terminology in the Introduction.\\n\\n Abandon  A race that a race committee or protest committee abandons is void but may be resailed.\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One boat is clear astern of another when her hull and equipment in normal position are behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other boat’s hull and equipment in normal position. The other boat is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a boat between them overlaps both. These terms always apply to boats on the same tack. They apply to boats on opposite tacks only when rule 18 applies between them or when both boats are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Committee  The protest committee, the race committee or the technical committee.\\n\\n Conflict of Interest  A conflict of interest exists if a person \\n\\n (a) may gain or lose as a result of a decision to which that person contributes,\\n\\n (b) may reasonably appear to have a personal or financial interest which could affect that person’s ability to be impartial, or\\n\\n (c) has a close personal interest in a decision. \\n\\n Continuing Obstruction  An obstruction is a continuing obstruction when the boat with the shortest hull referred to in the rule using the term will pass alongside it for at least three of her hull lengths. However, the following are not a continuing obstruction: a vessel under way, a boat racing, or a race committee vessel that is also a mark. \\n\\n Fetching  A boat is fetching a mark when she is in a position to pass to windward of it and leave it on the required side without changing tack.\\n\\n Finish A boat finishes when, after her starting signal, any part of her hull crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n 8\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or\\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course.\\n\\n After finishing she need not cross the finishing line completely. The sailing instructions may change the direction in which boats are required to cross the finishing line to finish. \\n\\n Keep Clear A boat keeps clear of a right-of-way boat\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way boat can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and,\\n\\n (b) when the boats are overlapped, if the right-of-way boat can also change course in both directions without immediately making contact.\\n\\n Leeward and Windward A boat’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind. However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her mainsail lies. The other side is her windward side. When two boats on the same tack overlap, the one on the leeward side of the other is the leeward boat. The other is the windward boat.\\n\\n Mark An object the sailing instructions require a boat to leave on a specified side, a race committee vessel surrounded by navigable water from which the starting or finishing line extends, and an object intentionally attached to the object or vessel. However, an anchor line is not part of the mark.\\n\\n Mark-Room  Room for a boat\\n\\n (a) to sail to the mark when her proper course is to sail close to it,\\n\\n (b) to round or pass the mark on the required side, and\\n\\n (c) to leave it astern.\\n\\n Obstruction  An obstruction is \\n\\n (a) an object that a boat could not pass without changing course substantially, if she were sailing directly towards it and one of her hull lengths from it;\\n\\n (b) an object that is so designated in a rule;\\n\\n (c) an object that can be safely passed on only one side; or\\n\\n (d) an area or line in a rule that boats are prohibited from entering or crossing. \\n\\n 9\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### However, a boat racing is not an obstruction to other boats unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. \\n\\n Overlap See Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap.\\n\\n Party A party to a hearing is\\n\\n (a) for a protest hearing: a protestor, a protestee;\\n\\n (b) for a redress hearing: a boat requesting redress or for which redress is requested; a boat for which a hearing is called to consider redress under rule 61.1; a committee acting under rule 61.1;\\n\\n (c) for a redress hearing under rule 61.4(b)(1): the body alleged to have made an improper action or omission;\\n\\n (d) a person against whom an allegation of a breach of rule 69.1(a) is made; a person presenting an allegation under rule 69.2(e)(1);\\n\\n (e) a support person subject to a hearing under rule 62 or 69; any boat that person supports; a person appointed to present an allegation under rule 62.2.\\n\\n However, the protest committee is never a party.\\n\\n Postpone A postponed race is delayed before its scheduled start but may be started or abandoned later.\\n\\n Proper Course A course a boat would choose in order to complete the leg she believes she is on as soon as possible in the absence of the other boats referred to in the rule using the term. A boat has no proper course before her starting signal.\\n\\n Protest An allegation made under rule 60 by a boat or a committee that a boat has broken a rule.\\n\\n Racing  A boat is racing from her preparatory signal until she finishes and clears the finishing line and marks or retires, or until the race committee signals a general recall, postponement or abandonment.\\n\\n Room The space a boat needs in the existing conditions, including space to comply with her obligations under the rules of Part 2 and rule 31, while manoeuvring promptly in a seamanlike way.\\n\\n 10\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

A fundamental principle of sportsmanship is that when a boat breaks a rule and is not exonerated, she will promptly take an appropriate penalty or action, which may be to retire.\\n ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\n Participants are encouraged to minimize any adverse environmental impact of the sport of sailing.\\n\\n#### PART 1',\n",

Each competitor is individually responsible for wearing a personal flotation device adequate for the conditions.\\n\\n 2 FAIR SAILING\\n\\n A boat and her owner shall compete in compliance with recognized principles of sportsmanship and fair play. A boat may be penalized under this rule only if it is clearly established that these principles\\n\\n 13\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### have been violated. The penalty shall be a disqualification that is not excludable.\\n\\n 3 DECISION TO RACE\\n\\n The responsibility for a boat’s decision to participate in a race or to continue racing is hers alone.\\n\\n 4 ACCEPTANCE OF THE RULES\\n\\n 4.1 (a) By participating or intending to participate in an event conducted under the rules, each competitor and boat owner agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n (b) A support person by providing support, or a parent or guardian by permitting their child to enter an event, agrees to accept the rules.\\n\\n 4.2 Each competitor and boat owner agrees, on behalf of their support persons, that such support persons are bound by the rules.\\n\\n 4.3 Acceptance of the rules includes agreement\\n\\n (a) to be governed by the rules;\\n\\n (b) to accept the penalties imposed and other action taken under the rules, subject to the appeal and review procedures provided in them, as the final determination of any matter arising under the rules;\\n\\n (c) with respect to any such determination, not to resort to any court of law or tribunal not provided for in the rules; and\\n\\n (d) by each competitor and boat owner to ensure that their support persons are aware of the rules.\\n\\n 4.4 The person in charge of each boat shall ensure that all competitors in the crew and the boat’s owner are aware of their responsibilities under this rule.\\n\\n 4.5 This rule may be changed by a prescription of the national authority of the venue.\\n\\n 5 RULES GOVERNING ORGANIZING AUTHORITIES  AND OFFICIALS\\n\\n 14\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

       "  '### WHEN BOATS MEET\\n\\n###### The rules of Part 2 apply between boats that are sailing in or near the racing area and intend to race, are racing, or have been racing. However, a boat not racing shall not be penalized for breaking one of these rules, except rule 14 when the incident resulted in injury or serious damage, or rule 23.1.\\n\\n When a boat sailing under these rules meets a vessel that is not, she shall comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS) or government right-of-way rules. If the notice of race so states, the rules of Part 2 are replaced by the right- of-way rules of the IRPCAS or by government right-of-way rules.\\n\\n SECTION A\\n#### RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n###### A boat has right of way over another boat when the other boat is required to keep clear of her. However, some rules in Sections B, C and D limit the actions of a right-of-way boat.\\n\\n 10 ON OPPOSITE TACKS\\n\\n When boats are on opposite tacks, a port-tack boat shall keep clear of a starboard-tack boat.\\n\\n 11 ON THE SAME TACK, OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and overlapped, a windward boat shall keep clear of a leeward boat.\\n\\n 12 ON THE SAME TACK, NOT OVERLAPPED\\n\\n When boats are on the same tack and not overlapped, a boat clear astern shall keep clear of a boat clear ahead.\\n\\n 13 WHILE TACKING\\n\\n After a boat passes head to wind, she shall keep clear of other boats until she is on a close-hauled course. During that time rules 10, 11 and 12 do not apply.

       "  '#### GENERAL LIMITATIONS\\n\\n###### 14 AVOIDING CONTACT\\n\\n If reasonably possible, a boat shall\\n\\n (a) avoid contact with another boat,\\n\\n (b) not cause contact between boats, and\\n\\n (c) not cause contact between a boat and an object that should be avoided.\\n\\n However, a right-of-way boat, or one sailing within the room or mark-room to which she is entitled, need not act to avoid contact until it is clear that the other boat is not keeping clear or giving room or mark-room. \\n\\n 15 ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY\\n\\n When a boat acquires right of way, she shall initially give the other boat room to keep clear, unless she acquires right of way because of the other boat’s actions.\\n\\n 16 CHANGING COURSE\\n\\n 16.1 When a right-of-way boat changes course, she shall give the other boat room to keep clear.\\n\\n 16.2 In addition, on a beat to windward when a port-tack boat is keeping clear by sailing to pass to leeward of a starboard-tack boat, the starboard-tack boat shall not bear away if as a result the port-tack boat must change course immediately to continue keeping clear.\\n\\n 17 ON THE SAME TACK; PROPER COURSE\\n\\n If a boat clear astern becomes overlapped within two of her hull lengths to leeward of a boat on the same tack, she shall not sail above her proper course while they remain on the same tack and overlapped within that distance, unless in doing so she promptly sails astern of the other boat.\\n\\n 17\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### SECTION C',\n",
       "  '#### AT MARKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS\\n\\n###### Section C rules do not apply between boats when the mark or obstruction referred to in those rules is a starting mark surrounded by navigable water or its anchor line, from the time the boats are approaching it to start until they have left it astern. \\n\\n 18 MARK-ROOM\\n\\n 18.1 When Rule 18 Applies\\n\\n (a) Rule 18 applies between boats when they are required to leave a mark on the same side and at least one of them is in the zone. However, it does not apply\\n\\n (1) between boats on opposite tacks on a beat to windward,\\n\\n (2) between boats on opposite tacks when the proper course at the mark for one but not both of them is to tack,\\n\\n (3) between a boat approaching a mark and one leaving it, or\\n\\n (4) if the mark is a continuing obstruction, in which case rule 19 applies. \\n\\n (b) Rule 18 no longer applies between boats when mark-room has been given. \\n\\n 18.2 Giving Mark-Room \\n\\n (a) When the first of two boats reaches the zone,\\n\\n (1) if the boats are overlapped, the outside boat at that moment shall give the inside boat mark-room;\\n\\n (2) if the boats are not overlapped, the boat that has not reached the zone at that moment shall give the other boat mark-room.\\n\\n When a boat is required to give mark-room by this rule, she shall continue to do so for as long as this rule applies, even if later an overlap is broken or a new overlap begins. \\n\\n (b) Rule 18.2(a) no longer applies if the boat entitled to mark-room passes head to wind or leaves the zone. \\n\\n 18\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",

The other kiteboard is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a kiteboard between them overlaps both. If there is reasonable doubt that two kiteboards are overlapped, it shall be presumed that they are not. These terms always apply to kiteboards on the same tack. They apply to kiteboards on opposite tacks only when both kiteboards are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Continuing Obstruction  An obstruction is a continuing obstruction when a kiteboard will pass alongside it for at least 30 metres. However, the following are not a continuing obstruction: a vessel under way, a kiteboard racing, or a race committee vessel that is also a mark. \\n\\n Finish A kiteboard finishes when, after her starting signal, while the competitor is in contact with the hull, any part of her hull, or the competitor, crosses the finishing line from the course side.

       "  '### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROTEST COMMITTEES\\n\\n###### This appendix is advisory only; in some circumstances changing these procedures may be advisable. It is addressed primarily to the protest committee chair but may also help judges, protest committee secretaries, race committees and others involved in hearings.\\n\\n In a hearing, the protest committee should weigh all testimony with equal care; should recognize that honest testimony can vary, and even be in conflict, as a result of different observations and recollections; should resolve such differences as best it can; should recognize that no boat or competitor is guilty until a breach of a rule has been established to the satisfaction of the protest committee; and should keep an open mind until all the evidence has been heard as to whether a boat or competitor has broken a rule.\\n\\n M1 PRELIMINARIES (may be performed by race office staff)\\n\\n (a) Receive the hearing request. \\n\\n (b) Note the time the hearing request is delivered and the protest time limit. \\n\\n (c) Inform each party, including any committee involved, when and where the hearing will be held (rule 63.1(a)(1)). \\n\\n M2 BEFORE THE HEARING\\n M2.1 Make sure that\\n\\n (a) each party has the opportunity to read the protest, request for redress or allegation and has had reasonable time to prepare for the hearing (rules 63.1(a)(2) and 63.1(a)(3)).\\n\\n (b) only one person from each party is present unless an interpreter is needed (rule 63.1(a)(4)).\\n\\n (c) all boats and people involved are represented. If they are not, however, the committee may proceed under rule 63.1(b).\\n\\n (d) boats’ representatives were on board when required (rule 63.1(a)(4)). \\n\\n 129\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n (e) when the parties were in different events, both organizing authorities accept the composition of the protest committee (rule 63.2(e)). \\n\\n (f) in a protest concerning class rules, obtain the current class rules and identify the authority responsible for interpreting them (rule 63.5(d)).\\n\\n M2.2 Determine if any members of the protest committee saw the incident. If so, require each of them to state that fact as soon as possible at the hearing (rule 63.4(d)).\\n\\n M2.3 Assess conflicts of interest.\\n\\n (a) Ensure that all protest committee members declare any possible conflicts of interest. At major events this will often be a formal written declaration made before the event starts that will be kept with the protest committee records.\\n\\n (b) At the start of any hearing, ensure that the parties are aware of any conflicts of interest of protest committee members. Ask the parties if they consent to the members. If a party does not object as soon as possible after a conflict of interest has been declared, the protest committee may take this as consent to proceed and should record it.\\n\\n (c) If a party objects to a member, the remainder of the protest committee members need to assess whether the conflict of interest is significant. The assessment will consider the level of the event, the level of the conflict and the perception of fairness. It may be acceptable to balance conflicts between protest committee members. Guidance may be found on the World Sailing website. Record the decision and the grounds for that decision.\\n\\n (d) In cases of doubt it may be preferable to proceed with a smaller protest committee. Except for hearings under rule 69, there is no minimum number of protest committee members required.\\n\\n (e) When a request for redress is made under rule 61.4(b)(1) and is based on an improper action or omission of a body other than the protest committee, a member of that body should not be a member of the protest committee.\\n\\n 130\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n M3 THE HEARING\\n M3.1 Check that the protest or request is valid.\\n\\n (a) Are the contents adequate (rule 60.3(a), 61.2(a) or 63.7(b))?\\n\\n (b) Was it delivered in time? If not, is there good reason to extend the time limit (rule 60.3(b), 61.2(b) or 63.7(b))?\\n\\n (c) When required, was the protestor involved in or a witness to the incident (rule 60.4(a)(2))?\\n\\n (d) When necessary, was ‘Protest’ hailed and, if required, a red flag displayed correctly (rule 60.2(a)(1))?\\n\\n (e) When the flag or hail was not necessary, was the protestee informed (rule 60.2(b))?\\n\\n (f) Decide whether the protest or request for redress is valid (rule 63.4(a)).\\n\\n (g) Once the validity of the protest or request has been determined, do not let the subject be introduced again unless truly new evidence is available.\\n\\n M3.2 Take the evidence (rule 63.4).\\n\\n (a) Ask the parties to tell their stories. Then allow them to question one another. In a redress matter, ask the party to state the request.\\n\\n (b) Make sure you know what facts each party is alleging before calling any witnesses. Their stories may be different.\\n\\n (c) Allow anyone, including a boat’s crew, to give evidence. It is the party who normally decides which witnesses to call, although the protest committee may also call witnesses (rule 63.4(b)). The question asked by a party ‘Would you like to hear N?’ is best answered by ‘It is your choice.’\\n\\n (d) Call each party’s witnesses (and the protest committee’s if any) one by one. Limit parties to questioning the witness(es). (They may wander into general statements.)\\n\\n (e) Invite the protestee to question the protestor’s witness first (and vice versa). This prevents the protestor from leading the witness from the beginning. \\n\\n (f) Allow members of the protest committee who saw the incident to give evidence (rule 63.4(d)). Members who give evidence\\n\\n 131\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n may be questioned, should take care to relate all they know about the incident that could affect the decision, and may remain on the protest committee (rule 63.4(e)).\\n\\n (g) Try to prevent leading questions, but if that is impossible discount the evidence so obtained.\\n\\n (h) The protest committee chair should advise a party or a witness giving hearsay, repetitive or irrelevant evidence that the protest committee must give such evidence appropriate weight, which may be little or no weight at all (rules 63.4(b) and 63.5(a)).\\n\\n (i) Ask one member of the committee to note down evidence, particularly times, distances, speeds, etc.\\n\\n (j) Invite questions from protest committee members.\\n\\n (k) Invite each party, starting with the party that requested the hearing, to make a final statement of her case, particularly on any application or interpretation of the rules.\\n\\n M3.3 Find the facts (rule 63.5(a)).\\n\\n (a) Write down the facts; resolve doubts one way or the other.\\n\\n (b) Call back parties for more questions if necessary.\\n\\n (c) When appropriate, draw a diagram of the incident using the facts you have found.\\n\\n M3.4 Decide the case (rule 63.5).\\n\\n (a) Base the decision on the facts found. (If you cannot, find some more facts.)\\n\\n (b) In redress cases, make sure that no further evidence is needed from boats that will be affected by the decision.\\n\\n M3.5 Inform the parties (rule 63.6).\\n\\n (a) Recall the parties and read them the facts found, conclusions and rules that apply, and the decision. When time presses it is permissible to read the decision and give the details later.\\n\\n (b) Give any party a copy of the decision on request. File the protest or request for redress with the committee records.\\n\\n 132\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n M4 REOPENING A HEARING (rule 63.7)\\n M4.1 When a party, within the time limit, has asked for a hearing to be reopened, hear the party making the request, look at any video, etc., and decide whether there is any significant new evidence that might lead you to change your decision. Decide whether your interpretation of the rules may have been wrong; be open-minded as to whether you have made a mistake. If none of these applies refuse to reopen; otherwise schedule a hearing.\\n\\n M4.2 Evidence is ‘new’\\n\\n (a) if it was not reasonably possible for the party asking for the reopening to have discovered the evidence before the original hearing,\\n\\n (b) if the protest committee is satisfied that before the original hearing the evidence was diligently but unsuccessfully sought by the party asking for the reopening, or\\n\\n (c) if the protest committee learns from any source that the evidence was not available to the parties at the time of the original hearing.\\n\\n M5 DISCRETIONARY PENALTIES (rule 64) \\n\\n Rule 64 enables a boat that has broken a rule subject to a discretionary penalty to comply with Sportsmanship and the Rules by reporting within the protest time limit that she has broken the rule. If the report does not include sufficient facts for the protest committee to decide what penalty to impose, the committee may question a representative of the boat and any witnesses to collect evidence it decides is appropriate. It is not necessary to conduct a hearing to collect this evidence. Note that guidelines for discretionary penalties may be found on the World Sailing website. \\n\\n M6 MISCONDUCT (rule 69)\\n M6.1 An action under this rule is not a protest, but the protest committee gives its allegations in writing to the competitor before the hearing. The hearing is conducted under rule 63, but the protest committee must have at least three members (rule 69.2(a)). Use the greatest care to protect the competitor’s rights.\\n\\n 133\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n M6.2 A competitor or a boat cannot protest under rule 69, but the hearing request form of a competitor who tries to do so may be accepted as a report to the protest committee, which can then decide whether or not to call a hearing.\\n\\n M6.3 Unless World Sailing has appointed a person for the role, the protest committee may appoint a person to present the allegation. This person might be a race official, the person making the allegation or other appropriate person. When no reasonable alternative person is available, a person who was appointed as a member of the protest committee may present the allegation.\\n\\n M6.4 When it is desirable to call a hearing under rule 69 as a result of a Part 2 incident, it is important to hear any boat-vs.-boat protest in the normal way, deciding which boat, if any, broke which rule, before proceeding against the competitor under rule 69.\\n\\n M6.5 Although action under rule 69 is taken against a competitor, boat owner or support person, and not a boat, a boat may also be penalized (rules 69.2(h)(2) and 62.4).\\n\\n M6.6 When a protest committee upholds a rule 69 allegation it will need to consider if it is appropriate to report to either a national authority or World Sailing. Guidance on when to report may be found in the World Sailing Case Book. When the protest committee does make a report, it may recommend whether or not further action should be taken.\\n\\n M6.7 Unless the right of appeal is denied in accordance with rule 70.3, a party to a rule 69 hearing may appeal the decision of the protest committee.\\n\\n M6.8 Further guidance for protest committees about misconduct may be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n M7 APPEALS (rule 70 and Appendix R)\\n\\n When decisions can be appealed,\\n\\n (a) retain the papers relevant to the hearing so that the information can easily be used for an appeal. Is there a diagram endorsed or prepared by the protest committee? Are the facts found sufficient? (Example: Was there an overlap? Yes or No. ‘Perhaps’ is not a fact found.) Are the names of the protest\\n\\n 134\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n committee members and other important information on the form?\\n\\n (b) comments by the protest committee on any appeal should enable the appeals committee to picture the whole incident clearly; the appeals committee knows nothing about the situation.\\n\\n M8 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE\\n\\n Photographs and videos can sometimes provide useful evidence but protest committees should recognize their limitations and note the following points:\\n\\n (a) The party producing the photographic evidence is responsible for arranging the viewing.\\n\\n (b) View the video several times to extract all the information from it.\\n\\n (c) The depth perception of any single-lens camera is very poor; with a telephoto lens it is non-existent. When the camera views two overlapped boats at right angles to their course, it is impossible to assess the distance between them. When the camera views them head on, it is impossible to see whether an overlap exists unless it is substantial.\\n\\n (d) Ask the following questions:\\n\\n (1) Where was the camera in relation to the boats?\\n\\n (2) Was the camera’s platform moving? If so in what\\n direction and how fast?\\n\\n (3) Is the angle changing as the boats approach the critical\\n point? Fast panning causes radical change.\\n\\n (4) Did the camera have an unrestricted view throughout?\\n\\n 135\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n#### APPENDIX N',\n",

       "  '### ARBITRATION\\n\\n###### All or part of this appendix applies only if the notice of race or sailing instructions so state. \\n\\n Arbitration adds an extra step to the protest resolution process but can eliminate the need for some protest hearings, thus speeding up the process for events in which many protests are expected. Further guidance on arbitration can be found in the World Sailing Judges Manual, which is available on the World Sailing website. \\n\\n T1 POST-RACE PENALTIES\\n\\n (a) Provided that rule 44.1(b) does not apply, a boat that may have broken one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31 in an incident may take a Post-Race Penalty at any time after the race until the beginning of a protest hearing involving the incident.\\n\\n (b) A Post-Race Penalty is a 30% Scoring Penalty calculated as stated in rule 44.3(c). However, rule 44.1(a) applies.\\n\\n (c) A boat takes a Post-Race Penalty by delivering to the arbitrator or a member of the protest committee a written statement that she accepts the penalty and that identifies the race number and where and when the incident occurred.\\n\\n T2 ARBITRATION MEETING\\n\\n An arbitration meeting will be held prior to a protest hearing for each incident resulting in a protest by a boat involving one or more rules of Part 2 or rule 31, but only if each party is represented by a person who was on board at the time of the incident. No witnesses will be permitted. However, if the arbitrator decides that rule 44.1(b) may apply or that arbitration is not appropriate, the meeting will not be held, and if a meeting is in progress, it will be closed.\\n\\n 152\\n\\n\\n-----',\n",
       "  '###### pp\\n\\n T3 ARBITRATOR’S OPINION\\n\\n Based on the evidence given by the representatives, the arbitrator will offer an opinion as to what the protest committee is likely to decide:\\n\\n (a) the protest is invalid,\\n\\n (b) no boat will be penalized for breaking a rule, or\\n\\n (c) one or more boats will be penalized for breaking a rule, identifying the boats and the penalties.\\n\\n T4 ARBITRATION MEETING OUTCOMES\\n\\n After the arbitrator offers an opinion,\\n\\n (a) a boat may take a Post-Race Penalty, and\\n\\n (b) a boat may ask to withdraw her protest. The arbitrator may then act on behalf of the protest committee in accordance with rule 63.2(a) to allow the withdrawal.\\n\\n Unless all protests involving the incident are withdrawn, a protest hearing will be held.\\n\\n 153\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nOfficial Partners\\n\\n\\nwww.sailing.org\\n\\n\\n-----']]"

The second, the appendices, provides details of rules, rules that apply to particular kinds of racing, and rules that affect only a small number of competitors or officials.\\n\\n Terminology  A term used in the sense stated in the Definitions is printed in italics or, in preambles, in bold italics (for example, racing and racing).\\n Each of the terms in the table below is used in The Racing Rules of Sailing with the meaning given.\\n\\n Term Meaning\\n Boat A sailboat and the crew on board, that are subject to the rules. \\n Competitor A person who races or intends to race in the event.\\n National A World Sailing member national authority. authority\\n Race The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) committee and any other person or committee performing a\\n race committee function.\\n Racing rule A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.\\n Technical The technical committee appointed under rule committee 89.2(c) and any other person or committee\\n performing a technical committee function. \\n Vessel Any boat or ship.\\n\\n Other words and terms are used in the sense ordinarily understood in nautical or general use. For a source of the nautical sense of a word, a reader may refer to The Equipment Rules of Sailing.\\n\\n Hails  A language other than English may be used for a hail required by the rules provided that it is reasonable for it to be understood by all boats affected. However, a hail in English is always acceptable.\\n\\n Notation  The notation ‘[DP]’ in a rule means that the penalty for a breach of the rule may, at the discretion of the protest committee, be\\n\\n 5\\n\\n|Sailing with the m|meaning given.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Term|Meaning|\\n|Boat|A sailboat and the crew on board, that are subject to the rules.|\\n|Competitor|A person who races or intends to race in the event.|\\n|National authority|A World Sailing member national authority.|\\n|Race committee|The race committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a race committee function.|\\n|Racing rule|A rule in The Racing Rules of Sailing.|\\n|Technical committee|The technical committee appointed under rule 89.2(c) and any other person or committee performing a technical committee function.|\\n|Vessel|Any boat or ship.|',\n",

Guidelines for discretionary penalties are available on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Revision  The racing rules are revised and published every four years by World Sailing, the international authority for the sport. This edition becomes effective on 1 January 2025 except that for an event beginning in 2024 the date may be postponed by the notice of race. Marginal markings indicate important changes to Parts 1–7 and the Definitions in the 2021–2024 edition. No changes are contemplated before 2029, but any changes determined to be urgent before then will be announced through national authorities and posted on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n Appendices  When the rules of an appendix apply, they take precedence over any conflicting rules in Parts 1–7 and the Definitions. Each appendix in this book is identified by a letter. Other appendices are available on the World Sailing website and are identified by two or three letters. A reference to a rule in an appendix will contain the letter or letters, and the rule number (for example, ‘rule A1’ or ‘rule MR1’). The letters I, K, L, O and Q are not used to designate appendices in this book. \\n\\n Development Rules  Development Rules may be approved by World Sailing for specific events or categories of events. They are available on the World Sailing website and are identified by the letters DR. \\n\\n Notice of Race and Sailing Instructions  Guides and templates for writing a notice of race and sailing instructions are available, in various file formats, on the World Sailing website at\\n www.sailing.org/racingrules. National authorities are encouraged to translate these guides and templates. \\n\\n World Sailing Regulations  The Regulations are referred to in the definition Rule and in rule 6, but they are not included in this book because they can be changed at any time. The most recent versions of the Regulations are published on the World Sailing website; new versions will be announced through national authorities.\\n\\n\\n###### 6\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Interpretations  World Sailing publishes the following authoritative interpretations of the racing rules:\\n\\n • The Case Book – Interpretations of the Racing Rules,\\n\\n • The Call Books, for various disciplines,\\n\\n • Interpretations of Rule 42, Propulsion, and\\n\\n • Interpretations of the Regulations, for those Regulations that\\n are rules.\\n These publications are available on the World Sailing website. Other interpretations of the racing rules are not authoritative unless approved by World Sailing. \\n\\n 7',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\n### DEFINITIONS\\n\\n###### A term used as stated below is shown in italic type or, in preambles, in bold italic type. The meaning of several other terms is given in Terminology in the Introduction.\\n\\n Abandon  A race that a race committee or protest committee abandons is void but may be resailed.\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap  One boat is clear astern of another when her hull and equipment in normal position are behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other boat’s hull and equipment in normal position. The other boat is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a boat between them overlaps both. These terms always apply to boats on the same tack. They apply to boats on opposite tacks only when rule 18 applies between them or when both boats are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Committee  The protest committee, the race committee or the technical committee.\\n\\n Conflict of Interest  A conflict of interest exists if a person \\n\\n (a) may gain or lose as a result of a decision to which that person contributes,\\n\\n (b) may reasonably appear to have a personal or financial interest which could affect that person’s ability to be impartial, or\\n\\n (c) has a close personal interest in a decision. \\n\\n Continuing Obstruction  An obstruction is a continuing obstruction when the boat with the shortest hull referred to in the rule using the term will pass alongside it for at least three of her hull lengths. However, the following are not a continuing obstruction: a vessel under way, a boat racing, or a race committee vessel that is also a mark. \\n\\n Fetching  A boat is fetching a mark when she is in a position to pass to windward of it and leave it on the required side without changing tack.\\n\\n Finish A boat finishes when, after her starting signal, any part of her hull crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n 8',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\n###### (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or\\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course.\\n\\n After finishing she need not cross the finishing line completely. The sailing instructions may change the direction in which boats are required to cross the finishing line to finish. \\n\\n Keep Clear A boat keeps clear of a right-of-way boat\\n\\n (a) if the right-of-way boat can sail her course with no need to take avoiding action and,\\n\\n (b) when the boats are overlapped, if the right-of-way boat can also change course in both directions without immediately making contact.\\n\\n Leeward and Windward A boat’s leeward side is the side that is or, when she is head to wind, was away from the wind.

The term ‘boat’ elsewhere in the rules means ‘kiteboard’ or ‘boat’ as appropriate. \\n\\n Note: Links to kiteboard rules for some other formats or competitions can be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n CHANGES TO THE DEFINITIONS\\n\\n The definitions Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap, Continuing Obstruction, Finish, Keep Clear, Leeward and Windward, Mark- Room, Obstruction, Start, Tack, Starboard or Port and Zone are changed to:\\n\\n Clear Astern and Clear Ahead; Overlap One kiteboard is clear astern of another when her hull is behind a line abeam from the aftermost point of the other kiteboard’s hull. The other kiteboard is clear ahead. They overlap when neither is clear astern. However, they also overlap when a kiteboard between them overlaps both. If there is reasonable doubt that two kiteboards are overlapped, it shall be presumed that they are not. These terms always apply to kiteboards on the same tack. They apply to kiteboards on opposite tacks only when both kiteboards are sailing more than ninety degrees from the true wind.\\n\\n Continuing Obstruction  An obstruction is a continuing obstruction when a kiteboard will pass alongside it for at least 30 metres. However, the following are not a continuing obstruction: a vessel under way, a kiteboard racing, or a race committee vessel that is also a mark. \\n\\n Finish A kiteboard finishes when, after her starting signal, while the competitor is in contact with the hull, any part of her hull, or the competitor, crosses the finishing line from the course side. However, she has not finished if after crossing the finishing line she\\n\\n (a) takes a penalty under rule 44.2,\\n\\n (b) corrects an error in sailing the course made at the line, or\\n\\n (c) continues to sail the course.\\n\\n 106\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### pp',\n",

However, when sailing by the lee or directly downwind, her leeward side is the side on which her kite lies. The other side is her windward side. When two kiteboards on the same tack overlap, the one whose hull is on the leeward side of the other’s hull is the leeward kiteboard. The other is the windward kiteboard.\\n\\n Mark-Room Room for a kiteboard to sail no farther from the mark than needed to sail her proper course to round or pass the mark on the required side, and room to pass a finishing mark after finishing. \\n\\n Obstruction  An obstruction is\\n\\n (a) an object that a kiteboard could not pass without substantially changing her course or the position of her kite, if she were sailing directly towards it and 10 metres from it;\\n\\n (b) an object that is so designated in a rule;\\n\\n (c) an object that can be safely passed on only one side; or\\n\\n (d) an area or line in a rule that kiteboards are prohibited from entering or crossing.\\n\\n However, a kiteboard racing is not an obstruction to other kiteboards unless they are required to keep clear of her or, if rule 22 applies, avoid her. \\n\\n Start A kiteboard starts when, her hull and the competitor having been entirely on the pre-start side of the starting line at or after her starting signal, any part of her hull or the competitor crosses the starting line from the pre-start side to the course side.\\n\\n 107',\n",

It is addressed primarily to the protest committee chair but may also help judges, protest committee secretaries, race committees and others involved in hearings.\\n\\n In a hearing, the protest committee should weigh all testimony with equal care; should recognize that honest testimony can vary, and even be in conflict, as a result of different observations and recollections; should resolve such differences as best it can; should recognize that no boat or competitor is guilty until a breach of a rule has been established to the satisfaction of the protest committee; and should keep an open mind until all the evidence has been heard as to whether a boat or competitor has broken a rule.\\n\\n M1 PRELIMINARIES (may be performed by race office staff)\\n\\n (a) Receive the hearing request. \\n\\n (b) Note the time the hearing request is delivered and the protest time limit. \\n\\n (c) Inform each party, including any committee involved, when and where the hearing will be held (rule 63.1(a)(1)). \\n\\n M2 BEFORE THE HEARING\\n M2.1 Make sure that\\n\\n (a) each party has the opportunity to read the protest, request for redress or allegation and has had reasonable time to prepare for the hearing (rules 63.1(a)(2) and 63.1(a)(3)).\\n\\n (b) only one person from each party is present unless an interpreter is needed (rule 63.1(a)(4)).\\n\\n (c) all boats and people involved are represented. If they are not, however, the committee may proceed under rule 63.1(b).\\n\\n (d) boats’ representatives were on board when required (rule 63.1(a)(4)). \\n\\n 129',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n (e) when the parties were in different events, both organizing authorities accept the composition of the protest committee (rule 63.2(e)). \\n\\n (f) in a protest concerning class rules, obtain the current class rules and identify the authority responsible for interpreting them (rule 63.5(d)).\\n\\n M2.2 Determine if any members of the protest committee saw the incident. If so, require each of them to state that fact as soon as possible at the hearing (rule 63.4(d)).\\n\\n M2.3 Assess conflicts of interest.\\n\\n (a) Ensure that all protest committee members declare any possible conflicts of interest. At major events this will often be a formal written declaration made before the event starts that will be kept with the protest committee records.\\n\\n (b) At the start of any hearing, ensure that the parties are aware of any conflicts of interest of protest committee members. Ask the parties if they consent to the members. If a party does not object as soon as possible after a conflict of interest has been declared, the protest committee may take this as consent to proceed and should record it.\\n\\n (c) If a party objects to a member, the remainder of the protest committee members need to assess whether the conflict of interest is significant. The assessment will consider the level of the event, the level of the conflict and the perception of fairness. It may be acceptable to balance conflicts between protest committee members. Guidance may be found on the World Sailing website. Record the decision and the grounds for that decision.\\n\\n (d) In cases of doubt it may be preferable to proceed with a smaller protest committee. Except for hearings under rule 69, there is no minimum number of protest committee members required.\\n\\n (e) When a request for redress is made under rule 61.4(b)(1) and is based on an improper action or omission of a body other than the protest committee, a member of that body should not be a member of the protest committee.\\n\\n 130',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M3 THE HEARING\\n M3.1 Check that the protest or request is valid.\\n\\n (a) Are the contents adequate (rule 60.3(a), 61.2(a) or 63.7(b))?\\n\\n (b) Was it delivered in time? If not, is there good reason to extend the time limit (rule 60.3(b), 61.2(b) or 63.7(b))?\\n\\n (c) When required, was the protestor involved in or a witness to the incident (rule 60.4(a)(2))?\\n\\n (d) When necessary, was ‘Protest’ hailed and, if required, a red flag displayed correctly (rule 60.2(a)(1))?\\n\\n (e) When the flag or hail was not necessary, was the protestee informed (rule 60.2(b))?\\n\\n (f) Decide whether the protest or request for redress is valid (rule 63.4(a)).\\n\\n (g) Once the validity of the protest or request has been determined, do not let the subject be introduced again unless truly new evidence is available.\\n\\n M3.2 Take the evidence (rule 63.4).\\n\\n (a) Ask the parties to tell their stories. Then allow them to question one another. In a redress matter, ask the party to state the request.\\n\\n (b) Make sure you know what facts each party is alleging before calling any witnesses. Their stories may be different.\\n\\n (c) Allow anyone, including a boat’s crew, to give evidence. It is the party who normally decides which witnesses to call, although the protest committee may also call witnesses (rule 63.4(b)). The question asked by a party ‘Would you like to hear N?’ is best answered by ‘It is your choice.’\\n\\n (d) Call each party’s witnesses (and the protest committee’s if any) one by one. Limit parties to questioning the witness(es). (They may wander into general statements.)\\n\\n (e) Invite the protestee to question the protestor’s witness first (and vice versa). This prevents the protestor from leading the witness from the beginning. \\n\\n (f) Allow members of the protest committee who saw the incident to give evidence (rule 63.4(d)).

Decide whether your interpretation of the rules may have been wrong; be open-minded as to whether you have made a mistake. If none of these applies refuse to reopen; otherwise schedule a hearing.\\n\\n M4.2 Evidence is ‘new’\\n\\n (a) if it was not reasonably possible for the party asking for the reopening to have discovered the evidence before the original hearing,\\n\\n (b) if the protest committee is satisfied that before the original hearing the evidence was diligently but unsuccessfully sought by the party asking for the reopening, or\\n\\n (c) if the protest committee learns from any source that the evidence was not available to the parties at the time of the original hearing.\\n\\n M5 DISCRETIONARY PENALTIES (rule 64) \\n\\n Rule 64 enables a boat that has broken a rule subject to a discretionary penalty to comply with Sportsmanship and the Rules by reporting within the protest time limit that she has broken the rule. If the report does not include sufficient facts for the protest committee to decide what penalty to impose, the committee may question a representative of the boat and any witnesses to collect evidence it decides is appropriate. It is not necessary to conduct a hearing to collect this evidence. Note that guidelines for discretionary penalties may be found on the World Sailing website. \\n\\n M6 MISCONDUCT (rule 69)\\n M6.1 An action under this rule is not a protest, but the protest committee gives its allegations in writing to the competitor before the hearing. The hearing is conducted under rule 63, but the protest committee must have at least three members (rule 69.2(a)). Use the greatest care to protect the competitor’s rights.\\n\\n 133',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n M6.2 A competitor or a boat cannot protest under rule 69, but the hearing request form of a competitor who tries to do so may be accepted as a report to the protest committee, which can then decide whether or not to call a hearing.\\n\\n M6.3 Unless World Sailing has appointed a person for the role, the protest committee may appoint a person to present the allegation. This person might be a race official, the person making the allegation or other appropriate person. When no reasonable alternative person is available, a person who was appointed as a member of the protest committee may present the allegation.\\n\\n M6.4 When it is desirable to call a hearing under rule 69 as a result of a Part 2 incident, it is important to hear any boat-vs.-boat protest in the normal way, deciding which boat, if any, broke which rule, before proceeding against the competitor under rule 69.\\n\\n M6.5 Although action under rule 69 is taken against a competitor, boat owner or support person, and not a boat, a boat may also be penalized (rules 69.2(h)(2) and 62.4).\\n\\n M6.6 When a protest committee upholds a rule 69 allegation it will need to consider if it is appropriate to report to either a national authority or World Sailing. Guidance on when to report may be found in the World Sailing Case Book. When the protest committee does make a report, it may recommend whether or not further action should be taken.\\n\\n M6.7 Unless the right of appeal is denied in accordance with rule 70.3, a party to a rule 69 hearing may appeal the decision of the protest committee.\\n\\n M6.8 Further guidance for protest committees about misconduct may be found on the World Sailing website.\\n\\n M7 APPEALS (rule 70 and Appendix R)\\n\\n When decisions can be appealed,\\n\\n (a) retain the papers relevant to the hearing so that the information can easily be used for an appeal. Is there a diagram endorsed or prepared by the protest committee? Are the facts found sufficient? (Example: Was there an overlap? Yes or No. ‘Perhaps’ is not a fact found.) Are the names of the protest\\n\\n 134',\n",
       " '-----\\n\\n###### pp\\n\\n committee members and other important information on the form?\\n\\n (b) comments by the protest committee on any appeal should enable the appeals committee to picture the whole incident clearly; the appeals committee knows nothing about the situation.\\n\\n M8 PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE\\n\\n Photographs and videos can sometimes provide useful evidence but protest committees should recognize their limitations and note the following points:\\n\\n (a) The party producing the photographic evidence is responsible for arranging the viewing.\\n\\n (b) View the video several times to extract all the information from it.\\n\\n (c) The depth perception of any single-lens camera is very poor; with a telephoto lens it is non-existent. When the camera views two overlapped boats at right angles to their course, it is impossible to assess the distance between them. When the camera views them head on, it is impossible to see whether an overlap exists unless it is substantial.\\n\\n (d) Ask the following questions:\\n\\n (1) Where was the camera in relation to the boats?\\n\\n (2) Was the camera’s platform moving? If so in what\\n direction and how fast?\\n\\n (3) Is the angle changing as the boats approach the critical\\n point? Fast panning causes radical change.\\n\\n (4) Did the camera have an unrestricted view throughout?\\n\\n 135',\n",
